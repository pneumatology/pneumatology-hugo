  Thy bridal chamber I see adorned, O my Savior,
  and I have no wedding garment that I may enter.
  O Giver of Light, enlighten the vesture of my soul, and save me.

  There were three buildings specifically for
  sacrifice in Jerusalem.
  
  The one facing the west was called "The Holy".
  
  Another, facing south, was called "The Holy of
  the Holy".
  
  The third, facing east, was called "The Holy
  of the Holies", the place where only the high
  priest enters.
  
  Baptism is "the Holy" building.
  
  Redemption is the "Holy of the Holy".
  
  "The Holy of the Holies" is the bridal
  chamber.

  Baptism includes the resurrection and the
  redemption; the redemption (takes place) in
  the bridal chamber.
  
  But the bridal chamber is in that which is
  superior to [...] you will not find [...] are

  Jerusalem, [...] those called the "Holy of the
  Holies" [...] the veil was rent, [...] bridal
  chamber except the image [...] above.
  
  Because of this, its veil was rent from top to
  bottom.
  
  For it was fitting for some from below to go
  upward.
  
  The powers do not see those who are clothed in
  the perfect light, and consequently are not
  able to detain them.

  One will clothe himself in this light
  sacramentally in the union.
  
  If the woman had not separated from the man,
  she should not die with the man.
  
  His separation became the beginning of death.
  
  Because of this, Christ came to repair the
  separation, which was from the beginning, and
  again unite the two, and to give life to those
  who died as a result of the separation, and
  unite them.
  
  But the woman is united to her husband in the
  bridal chamber.
  
  Indeed, those who have united in the bridal
  chamber will no longer be separated.
  
  Thus Eve separated from Adam because it was
  not in the bridal chamber that she united with
  him.

This is my visceral experience of the Bridal Chamber.

  It is a hymn of deep irony and paradox.
  
  The “Bridal Chamber” carries a double meaning.
  
  It is, at once, the place of mystical union
  between Christ and His Bride (the Church).
  
  At the same time, it is the grave of Christ
  Himself.
  
  For that mystical union with Christ begins by
  being “buried with Christ in His death” (in
  Holy Baptism).
  
  The marriage of Christ and His Bride is in the
  paradox of the hideous maw of death’s domain,
  at the same time the place of Christ’s utter
  triumph over every adversary.
  
  We are not removed from that terrible place –
  we are healed precisely there.
  
  The resurrection of Christ begins in the tomb.
