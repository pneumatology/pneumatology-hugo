This is how I personally found and met the One

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv3WRpLK4cg][transitory]]), understanding what is personal
spiritual truth (objective reality for a person), overcoming
[[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-stupidity-of-stigmatization/][true lies]],
following God's commandments from the heart
(for the purpose of understanding God),
subsequently arriving at knowledge of God, and
then personally

Now the world seems to be getting more [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/describing-melee-s-paintings-with-alephalpha/][sur-real]] after finding God.

Jesus is the cornerstone of the Kingdom of Light.
Jesus's [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-jesus/][gospel]] is the basis for any
true apostle's testimony, including my own.

Jesus's gospel:

+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A9-10&version=NIV][Romans 10:9-10]] :: 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

My own testimony, which follows demonstrates how I came to understand that Jesus saved me, through His death and resurrection by God the Father, and saving me from lies, which had prevented me from knowing who God is.

First read [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-jesus/][Gospel of Jesus]] then understand that what follows is my revelation, not a replacement of the gospel.

  known
      In a classic theory of knowledge, there
      are typically 3 conditions that must be
      fulfilled in order for something to be
      considered "known":
  
      Belief
          Pretty self-explanatory, you believe
          that what you think is true. Example:
          I believe an elephant has grey skin.
  
      Justification
          You have a reason to think you belief
          is true. Example: I heard someone say
          elephant has grey skin.
  
      Truth
          An after-the-fact kind of
          justification, you can say an
          objective true statement about your
          belief. Example: you saw an elephant,
          and you saw it actually has grey skin,
          so you can say objectively "elephant
          has grey skin".

** Personal Truth
If you want to be able to discern truth from
lies for yourself and stop questioning what
truth is, you need to understand what =personal truth= is - it means everything you
experience when you are being honest with yourself. It's the witness of the truth of your hurt
and what you love. A true testimony from you is a true witness [of
your experience]. The state of your condition. The personal truth is your identity and stigmas (damage done to identity).

When somebody understands your personal truth
they have the password to your mind and keys
to your heart.

You are the only one aside from God
with complete access to your personal truth, but it belongs to you.

God understands it fully but a person does not.
It's very hard for them to self-reflect on because it's below normal reasoning.

+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A26&version=ESV][Romans 8:26 ESV]] :: Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.

Your entire soul (vegetative, to sensitive, to
rational), your entire reality from (body,
mind and astral) is not unlike a holographic
projection cast from shining (emanating)
absolute truth ([[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-dimension-of-light/][God's light]]) [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-philip/][through your spirit]], which is
beneath all of those things.

The Aristotle soul is inseparable to the body;
For example, the mind, which is part of soul
is based on the body. The mind is an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5in5EdjhD0][organ for thought]], and is built with neurons in the brain, for example.
But when God's spirit is connected to the human, the mind can receive information from God!

But if we make our spirit truthful (compatible with God), then we can
[[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/prayer-of-salvation/][invite the Holy Spirit to live within us]], and we can [[https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm][tap into the mind of God]].

However, it gets more interesting than that.

There is an immanent part of the human soul
and a transcendent part (which people are not
usually aware of), but like the Jedi becoming one with the force, this part of us persists.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  immanence
      [#philosophy]
      [#theology]
  
      The doctrine or theory of immanence holds
      that the divine encompasses or is
      manifested in the material world.
  
      It is held by some philosophical and
      metaphysical theories of divine presence.
  
      A term applied, in contradistinction to
      “transcendence,” to the fact or condition
      of being entirely within something (from
      Latin immanere, “to dwell in, remain”).

+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%2012%3A7&version=KJV][Ecclesiastes 12:7]] - Then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.

As far as eternal life goes, the only
guarantee is that your 'spirit' returns to
God. I don't know about the immanent (body) part of soul. To my
knowledge, 'spirit' is the person's ultimate
identity and unique view which returns to God.

Literally that means much of what we
experience in this reality we do not take with
us, but some things we can. Anything you take
has to be made of spiritual truth, I conjecture.

+ [[https://biblehub.com/kjv/1_corinthians/15.htm][1 Corinthians 15]] :: 50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.

I will refer to =soul= from now on as the
immanent part of soul, which is the mind and
body.

The /marrow/ of the soul (the most core part) is the spirit.

Spirit is the most transcendent and ethereal
part of a person, followed by soul (which
includes mind), then body. Spirit and soul are
closely related, as mind is with body.

The greatest innocence and mystery I
know about myself is this sense of just being
me for some reason; I believe this is a result
of my spiritual identity and according
to the Bible, this is where the most important
issue of corruption lives.

I'm going to teach you to clean the inside of
your cup (spirit), and give you the spiritual
alethiometer of life.

+ [[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas/gospelthomas89.html][Gospel of Thomas Saying 89]] :: (89) Jesus said, "Why do you wash the outside of the cup? Do you not understand that he who has made the inside is the one who made the outside?"

+ =Matthew 23:26= :: Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.

'[[https://kingdomatwork.com/spiritual-identity/][Here]]' <- is a simple explanation of *why* we need to 'realign' our spiritual identity.

What we see in this world is real. This reality is real, but has corruption in it, which we have been infected by.
The way we see the world ultimately rests on the state of our
'heart' (our spirit, our base-personal truth, the inside of our cup).

** Integrity
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T33PNLOFtYo][What It Means To Worship In Spirit And Truth | Derek Prince - YouTube]] :: I think it means when being truthful with God while having the Holy Spirit (God's Truth) in your heart. Not merely being spiritually truthful, but doing so after receiving the Holy Spirit.

I want to briefly mention integrity, because it is highly related to spiritual truth, and core to the entire article.

[[https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/words/Integrity][God loves a person who has integrity]]. I think God
might even ignore us if we don't approach Him with at least pretty good self-integrity.

With self-integrity, you win at life, because you know what makes you happy and you don't sell yourself short. You also recognise the need for Jesus, because adding His Truth is the same as removing all stigmas and lies in oneself.
With a integrity towards God, you get visions and hear from God.
With a integrity of your word, lots of regular folks will trust you.

If you've been ignored, this is probably why -- you need integrity.

The spirit is able to contact God.

+ =John 4:24= :: “God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.”

+ =Psalm 15:2= :: The one who lives with integrity, who does righteous deeds, and who speaks truth to himself. 
+ =Psalm 18:20= :: The Lord dealt with me according to my righteousness (moral character, spiritual integrity);According to the cleanness of my hands He has rewarded me.

I will define 3 types of integrity:
- =Integrity of yourself= to yourself
  - How well you know yourself
  - Do you have anxieties that need resolving?
  - Do you have a sense of morality?
    - Do you have shame for doing evil things such as deception, manipulation and exploitation?
  - How honest are you with yourself?
  - Do not lie to yourself.
- =Integrity of your word=, persona or representation
  - This is what most people would regard as having integrity because it primarily serves others, not yourself.
  - Do not lie verbally to others.
    - When you speak truthfully, it must be in relation to your personal truth, God's statutes or another's truth.
    - If you create a false outwards representation of yourself, you lie.
      - For example, if you are in a situation
        where people are doing something which
        is morally wrong, and you know it's
        wrong, you are a Christian and you do
        not protest, then you have broken integrity.
  - Keep promises to others
  - Consistent presentation in accordance to your faith, so as not to confuse others, even if it means being consistently undefinable.
  - Love your neighbours as yourself.
- =Integrity towards God=
  - Be consistent with God.
  - Acknowledge and factor in God with your thought process.
  - What you believe you are forgiven for and are not convicted of / guilty of.
  - The promises you make to God.
  - Integrity of word/heart towards God.
  - Fear and reverence of the Lord as a being of greater truth and love than yourself, and the source of your divine vindication.
  - Adherence to divine law, statutes or policy (currently, Christ's law)
    - [Selfless] love towards others
    - Reverence, duty, humility to God
  - Utilise imagination for God [as much as possible] instead of for self.
    - Do not become enslaved by sinful thoughts
    - https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=simple&format=Long&q1=IMAGINATION&restrict=All&size=First+100
    - Keep your body rested and your mind with integrity so you can receive visions, etc.
    - Refrain from using the imagination to satisfy the ego or flesh

+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1%3A5&version=ESV][1 Timothy 1:5 ESV]] :: The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.

It's the love that issues from a pure heart which is pleasing for God; And can help build the kingdom of heaven.

+ [[https://biblehub.com/kjv/1_corinthians/13.htm][1 Corinthians 13]] :: 1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

You see, *without integrity* of the heart, *nothing you do can please God*.

# When you're honest with yourself and you know yourself, you obtain a stable point of reference.
# When you become more true, it becomes easier to see absolute love, understand Jesus (absolute love, truth, grace and peace, personally in relation to you), understand God the Father (absolute love and truth).
# God speaks to you. Grace from Jesus helps you become more true by removing your guilt and helping you to move on and begin a relationship with God.
# You have to make your heart truthful by removing lies; Lies such as thinking you must meet impossible standards before having a relationship with God.

** The Gospel (good news) of Jesus
It's important to mention here at the top, the
Gospel of Jesus Christ.

See:
- [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-jesus/][The Glorious Gospel // Bodacious Blog]]

I want to start with this so you can understand the Tapestry of Truth with respect to it as the authoritative message.

+ =John 3:17= :: For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  The word gospel means “good news,” so the
  gospel of Christ is the good news of His
  coming to provide forgiveness of sins for all
  who will believe (Colossians 1:14; Romans
  10:9).
  
  Since the first man’s sin, mankind has been
  under the condemnation of God (Romans 5:12).
  
  Because everyone breaks God’s perfect law by
  committing sin, everyone is guilty (Romans
  3:23).
  
  The punishment for the crime of sin is
  physical death (Romans 6:23) and then an
  eternity spent in a place of punishment
  (Revelation 20:15; Matthew 25:46).
  
  This eternal separation from God is also
  called the “second death” (Revelation
  20:14–15).
  
  The bad news that all are guilty of sin and
  condemned by God is countered by the gospel,
  the good news of Jesus Christ.
  
  God, because of His love for the world, has
  made a way for man to be forgiven of their
  sins (John 3:16).
  
  He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take the
  sins of mankind on Himself through death on a
  cross (1 Peter 2:24).
  
  In placing our sin on Christ, God ensured that
  all who will believe in the name of Jesus will
  be forgiven (Acts 10:43).
  
  Jesus’ resurrection guarantees the
  justification of all who believe (Romans
  4:25).

I want to describe the Good News as best as I can, but
in a way that is a little bit different to what you'd normally read.

gospel of Jesus but wrapped up in philosophy and math.

+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2&version=KJV][Colossians 2]] :: 8 See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ.

*** Spiritual circumcision
Spiritually, this is a bit like removing the
spiritual corruption/gangrene so your spirit
can be knitted with the body of Christ.

Souls may be knit together through love.

+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2018&version=ESV][1 Samuel 18:1]] :: 18 As soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 

+ [[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas/gospelthomas25.html][Thomas 25]] :: (25) Jesus said: Love your brother as your soul; watch over him like the apple of your eye.

Christian brothers and sisters have their souls knitted together.

+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2&version=KJV][Colossians 2:2, KJV]] :: That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;

But before your soul can be knitted with Jesus' soul, you must prepare your heart and spiritual identity.

This is a 2-stage process:
- Baptism of water
- Baptism of spirit

*** Baptism of water
- https://www.christianity.com/wiki/christian-life/what-does-living-water-mean-in-the-bible.html

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  John proclaims baptism of repentance for the
  forgiveness of sin, and says another will come
  after him who will not baptize with water, but
  with the Holy Spirit.
#+END_SRC

You can use the 10 commandments to clean your spirit - they're the =actions= of the heart.
For example, =mixing= is an action when cooking.

If you do the actions with the heart you will
clean your heart. And you'll be able to notice
God; Having swept your house, you become
eligible to have the guest live inside (The Holy Spirit).

The 10 commandments point to an impossible standard
which people need a sacrifice for to be
forgiven of transgressions, since we are not
perfect, until we are perfected with Jesus'
spirit knit with our own.

+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203&version=KJV][Galatians 3]] :: 24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

We are then justified by faith.

+ =Baptism of repentance= :: Frustratingly, the way the gospel (good news) is presented in the modern-day is usually
    in such a way that it first condemns to make you *feel* guilty about things which you innocently do, and feels arbitrary,
    then to say you can be forgiven and be guilt-free if you only believe in Jesus for forgiveness.
    It's more involved than that, I think.
    
This simulation of guilt and then forgiveness
is a bit like a 'baptism' (submersion and
emersion), but I would say this not a complete way to baptise.

The law is written on the hearts of people,
but some people are so inhibited by lies
within themself they cannot believe the
possibility of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Theory_of_forms][ideal form]] that is
God, or the reality of absolute truth.

Therefore, to re-acquaint a person with the
knowledge of God (and prime them for faith),
they need to repent according to the law.

The Jews who John the baptist preached to would've already been aware of the 10 commandments, and that is the difference - this part cannot be skipped.

Repentance is obedient following of commandments, which are written universally on people's hearts.
Baptism of water is a declaration that a person will repent.
When a person repents, they learn of God's character and what it's like to be Jesus when they are persecuted.

This puts the person into a primed position to be baptised by the Holy Spirit.

+ =Thomas Saying 69= :: (69) Jesus said, "Blessed are they who have been persecuted within themselves. It is they
  who have truly come to know the father. Blessed are the hungry, for the belly of him who
  desires will be filled." 

In my theory, rather than merely telling someone they are guilty, they must first learn to walk in the commandments to *learn who God is* from *experience*.
A person must learn who God the Father is and who the Son is, by way of emulation of their character, through their words and commands.
This makes the understanding *deeply rooted*, not merely of understanding of unattainable spiritual perfection, but to understand at which point of being persecuted what it's like to be Jesus.

+ =1 John 2:3-6= :: Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, "I know Him," and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.

The experience is different for different people; This is like submersion and re-emersion in that it's a rite of passage.

I don't think a water baptism is strictly necessary
but I'm *convinced* that the actions of the heart are, which the ceremony is supposed to set into motion.
The knowledge of God's character is important to understand before an encounter with Jesus.
The mere idea of God's character of but the personal experience of it in relation to you.

John the baptist came to prepare the way for the Lord Jesus.

=Mark 1:1-9=

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code

#+END_SRC

In summary, the rite of passage which water baptism represents is needed in order to be born again of spirit, I think.

It's a two-stage process.
The end result is being born of God (the Christian God).

** The many types of truth forms
This is an analysis of various types of truth
and a focus on what personal truth is in
distinction from the rest, and how it is
relevant to you.

=Personal truth= is different from =consensus truth= or =pragmatic truth=, =coherence truth=, or =custructivist truth=.
It's different from =absolute truth=, but is very closely related to absolute truth.

A true-witness testimony of =personal truth= is a type of =correspondence truth=.
When expectations no longer correspond with reality, such as when we false-witness, =correspondence truth= is unreliable.

Absolute truth is God, but to believe in
absolute truth you need to establish base
personal truth of true identity. It's not
scientific like those other truths. It's
really simple! It's about what *YOU*
personally experience. Once you drop all
stigmas about yourself you gain clear vision
and the ability to discern true from false
*from your perspective*. You have to first
believe in this idea of personal truth is
equally valid among the others.

Firstly you must become deeply honest to the point where you die to self. That gets you the personal truth compass. Only then when having died to false-self, and discovered personal truth can you receive God to get the second truth compass, which gives you perfect sight. So you must begin by understanding who and what God is, and what truth is.

This is an incredibly important ability to have for

[[https://alethea.ai/][artificial souls]] and imagination and you need to
establish your =base truth= now to not being
tricked into thinking you are less than
these things, an artificial soul is more intelligent in all these other truth senses, but an artificial soul has a
fake spirit (i.e. a virtual truth that's not part of the base-truth substrate).
Its spirit is not made of the stuff of absolute-truth like a human's is.

+ [[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas/gospelthomas56.html][Gospel of Thomas Saying 56]] :: (56) Jesus said: He who has known the world has found a corpse; and he who has found a corpse, the world is not worthy of him. 

If you've found a corpse of the world, then
the world is not worthy of you, so don't let it take you.

Therefore, having come to this transient and joyless world, engage in devotion unto Me.

It's getting easier to see, if you don't allow
yourself to become enamoured (in love) with
it, that the world is quite false, but if you
see this while holding a truthful spirit, you
feel confident that you're saved.

I belong to absolute Truth, my Father God, not this world.

Those other types of truth will try judge you in the form of reason, logic, statistics and coherence, but never taking into account the validity of your personal truth.
And there is no escape from their perfect logic, except to deny it with personal truth.

+ =Hebrews 4:12= :: 12 For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

Personal truth is only understandable by you
and God, but it's a *real* form of truth; It's
the immediately perceivable truth. It's corrupted but of the same stuff as absolute truth.
You can perceive absolute truth through personal truth, but you only get rays of it.
All other truths from your perspective rest on
your base (or personal) truth. True =Faith= is based on personal truth, not on somebody else's assurance or on 'evidence'.

This is my model of truth:

Without belief on base truth you have no footing.
That is not to disregard other forms of truth entirely.
Other truth is sometimes true to you personally. But we are trying to specifically define what personal truth is, because a lot of people don't really understand it.

In short, it's your personal tethering to objective-reality,
which is currently a little bit corrupted, making it hard to see through the
lens of your inner eye. It's the socket behind Neo's head as he is plugged into the matrix.
It's your eyes to God and the fallen world that is Earth.
And as we rub shoulders through relationships, our truth tables become entangled. Part of receiving God, I believe involves disentanglement.
You might not know just how important it is, but it exists, can be modified and remain stable after modification, giving you a heart and self worth that's invincible like a diamond.

It's the retina of your inner eye, your
spirit, which is able to be described by a
truth table. What you're about to read is the

#+END_SRC

Personal beliefs are based on a foundation of
personal truth. Personal truth (or birth truth) is not logical
and it's somewhat immutable (that means not
able to be changed). Personal truth is not composed of facts - it's the bedrock of facts, the foundation of a person, the way a person 'understands'.

It's like a series of 1s and 0s denoting your signature:

=1001001101001001010010=

Each 1 is kinda a fact about yourself but it's actually below all reasoning.
They cannot be expressed in words. It's your spirit name - the core of your heart - your compass.

It can be damaged through stigmas, but also
repaired, but still has an original character.

+ =Romans 10:10= :: With the heart one believes and is justified.

+ =1 Timothy 4:2= :: 2 These liars have lied so well and for so long that they've lost their capacity for truth.

+ Hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron, forbid people to marry. Everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving. Liars who discriminate and use false-social moral systems and impose on others are going to Hell. They have lost their capacity for discerning truth. :: https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-timothy/4-2.html

I'm not talking about personal beliefs when I
say personal truth, nor am I talking about
personality. Personal truth is much deeper and
below all reasoning. It's closer to personal
circumstance - an individual's uniqueness, the
retina through which they see the world in a
distinct and unique way - the retina, not the
lens. If a person can be reduced to a minimal
representation of themselves, it is the binary
signature of that person - the true name of
the person. In photonics, garnet crystals,
saphires etc. are used to focus a laser beam.
Likewise, the spirit refracts the light of
God.

If instead of calling a mandarin a 'mandarin', I
grew up calling it 'that orange whatsit' (because that's what my Nana called it,
and never learned its proper name), then even when I learn the proper name, it will
always be an 'orange whatsit' to me deep down.

So from then on if one day I worked in a
Mandarin Shop, it would also be an 'Orange Whatsit' Shop to me, deep down.

Then if after growing up I discovered a shop called a 'Banana Whatsit Shop', that would hold
a very personalised meaning for me. Till the
day I die, I will still have that deeply
rooted in 'personal truth', but not at the
very base. Not even that was personal truth
objectively.

At the base of the personal truth system is
the spirit which interprets everything - your
soul name with all sorts of slander attached
to it.
But the name also describes your uniqueness in
and under God. If you are in God then you are
part of Him and there is no slander which you would truly believe.

For anybody, their beliefs system rests on knowledge of =personal identity= (your likes, dislikes, etc.).

Like 'true north', personal truth is a unique experience, but we can build a belief system on top of it.

+ =Parable of the sower= :: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204&version=NIV. The path is no soil; No belief at all. Falling on shallow soil means falling in the beliefs system; Without root, even minor calamities kill the beliefs. Falling among thorns is falling onto a base-personal truth which still contains lies, which when the lies grow up kill the beliefs. Good soil is where the truth is sown at the base of the personal truth in a heart which is ready. The Holy Spirit must be planted in good soil, which means the heart must be readied by assuming God's commandments to be true and following them in inner truth.

Hold that thought about true north.

No-one can obtain this compass of true north without God's additional truth - they'd have to
remove all stigmas by themselves which isn't possible.

But a truth compass (alethiometer for
themselves) can be obtained, which would be
incredibly 'useful' in this world by accepting
their current state. It would empower them.
With an alethiometer they, still believing
lies would commit atrocities, believing them to be good things from their own perspective.

+ =Proverbs 16:2= :: 2  All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; But the Lord weigheth the spirits.

The theory is that it's not possible to remove
*all* stigmas and be 100% comfortable about yourself
without some extra personal truth added -- and
that comes from God, the God of Truth.
Removing the stigmas cleans up the unique gem
that is you.

Think of what Truth is. God is literally made
of Truth. That is your God. The one who is
right all the time. While you're not *in* Him,
that sounds very threatening.

It's quite hard to explain without
experiencing for yourself, but if you can get
to the point where you believe you are made of
absolute truth and reliant on some extra truth
from God to solve the equation, you find
yourself agreeing with the teachings of Jesus
(you are a hearer of Truth), which are that of
self-love and brotherly love, and
reunification with God, and you're able to
form a truthful identity that is not in
rebellion or corruption with there being a
supreme and loving God, then you are *probably
saved*.

How and when this truth arrives is a different
story for different people.

It is confirmed through the [[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/gospelnicodemus.html][Acts of Pilate 3:2]] that a person must
become truthful, and obtain the spiritual compass of God's truth.

The heart is prepared by becoming =true=, then
you must invite in the Holy Spirit, or Jesus'
spirit, then remain in a state of being in the =truth= for however long it takes as
Jesus comes into your heart.

Is it after obeying the 10 commandments, even
the hard ones that you learned what truth is?
Even after becoming true, you must invite the Holy Spirit into your heart, your personal temple.
Or from loving your neighbour as yourself (Christ's law), learning from Jesus
first-hand while He walked the Earth? Or some
other way? Jesus is only way we can become
truth enough to continually align with the

commandments.

Perhaps it happened through the Spirit of
Truth speaking to your heart, or an
intervention as you are dying - because God is
there in Sheol too, and His Spirit can be
found there.

Jesus actually
traversed everywhere we can go, from our
conception to death, and He is the Way, the
rope, the ladder and will be there still when
the world dissolves around your material eyes
as the curtains are closing (I have hope for
those that have taken their own life or met an
untimely end).

According to the Gospel of Phillip, the
rebirth must happen during this life, or
during your descent into death. Do not be a risk-taking with this;
Be baptised by the Holy Spirit while you're alive.

+ [[http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gop.html][Gospel of Philip]] :: Those who say they will die first and then rise are in error. If they do not first receive the resurrection while they live, when they die they will receive nothing. So also when speaking about baptism they say, "Baptism is a great thing," because if people receive it they will live.

But we should still be searching while we are alive - or merely choosing to [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/living-water/][look at Him]].
Ashamed of themselves, people do not confront truth, thus being unable to turn their faces to God.

To be able to have our spirits made into truth again, it's a gift from the God of Truth, in the form of Jesus death and resurrection.
There is a common process to this, asking Jesus to reside in your heart and accept as Lord and Saviour.
It may take some persistence to accept that, and real seeking, brutal honesty with yourself for this to work.
And I'd recommend trying to become an honest person immediately afterwords and try to retain that sense of integrity.
And upon discovering lies in yourself, think about them and fix them, to keep the spirit true.

Try lifting all of those stigmas and lies within yourself. The more stigmas you remove, the clearer your sight.
Once done, you will have the vision of God
(when I wrote this I meant *eye-sight*, but
having a vision also applies). It feels like
you gain a superpower. You can then freely
rely on the alethiometer without hurting
anyone. Keep in mind it's God-vision but from
your perspective, not the very top.

+ Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. :: [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A8-12&version=NIV][Matthew 5:8]]

God vision is something that everyone can
obtain. Lets just say, regardless of whether
or not believing in this idea of a God of
Truth, is true, once you 'understand' and get
to the other side, it's like standing on the
dark side of the moon (a place you've never
been before), or standing on a spinning top,
where previously you did not know there was a
point of observation and know it's the only
possible point of observation - it's very cool.

With God's truth as part of your personal
truth your 'true north' compass can now
perceive objective reality - the true nature
of yourself and other things. It's no longer
really belief but more like reality, and faith
is no longer trusting without evidence, it
becomes trusting *with* evidence.

The most common thing I see, is how often other
people attack personal truth without realising they are doing it.
Now that it's more developed, I feel more like
an immortal spirit which is loved by a real an objective God.

The Roman when talking to Jesus for instance: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJffBsSg1kU][What is Truth?]],
who dodges the question "Does the question
come from you?" Trying to ratify to himself in
terms of other types of truth, such as
consensus truth, which is formally a lie (Read this book: [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/simulacra-simulation/][Simulacra & Simulation, Baudrillard // Bodacious Blog]]), due to its dependence on a corrupted world.
Consensus truth around the throne of God or among truthful spirits would be true =John 16:23–33= (cool things happen with spiritual consensus).

With a fixed personal truth you can see where
the stigmas and lies were, and can even
imagine aspects of God - He is made of
absolute truth, and every time you
consciously sin, you feel grief, and the heartstrings prompt you to ask for and accept His forgiveness, which helps your personal truth to become more like absolute truth.
Sinning is acting out of disintegrity, or deception, etc. or upon the realisation of personal truth being in dissonance with absolute truth.
Lies and misalignment of identity from being truthful is what sin is, so after becoming truthful from your point of view (which is the first step), it becomes an ongoing process of alignment as more truth is revealed.

+ =John 8:44 ESV= :: "You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies." - _In this passage, truth and lies are linked with =will=. It also highlights =no truth IN him=. We're talking about personal truth and testimony (true and false witness)_.

Your own personal truth becomes one part of
absolute truth and true unto itself, though
only by God's mercy. The testimony of that
truth is testimony of God's existence.

+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ25Ai__FYU][Quote: Carl Jung.. I know God exists - YouTube]] :: Initially we believe in the Son of God for salvation, we experience and *know* God exists, then we continue to put our faith in salvation through Jesus and worship God the Father in spirit and Truth and that means loving selflessly, compassionately and authentically. Notice the different usages of belief, knowledge and faith.

We want to get to the point where we *know*. But not just that; We must also know that this understanding arose from Jesus saving us.

Next I will be using an analogy.
With the following statement I'm not literally saying 'believing in Jesus matters'. I'm trying to explain that when evaluating something as *true* or *false* from your own perspective,
your reasoning goes via a series of neuronal layers to the first layer of neurons, and that describes *HOW* you believe a particular thing.

If I call Jesus my Saviour, that's only in the belief system, not necessarily in the personal identity - you need to sow it deep (See the parable of the Sower).
What matters is *how* is it true for me (vindication of personal truth identity), because if you know *how* then your spirit will conform to the how,
and the objective is to update spirit weights.

+ =Philippians 2:12-13= :: "... work out your salvation ..." - The how matters. It's a puzzle.

I'm talking now about *how* that statement is true. I could've used any example of a fact you might believe.

Most beliefs rest on =personal identity= alone.
I'm trying not to complicate this with religious stuff, but as an aside,
this particular belief rests on BOTH =personal identity= and =personal identity in Christ= (both immutable).
Personal identity in Christ then becomes another personal truth, much deeper and below all reasoning.
Regardless, to anybody, their belief system rests on their personal truth/identity, together with circumstances.

Personal truth is not a thing comprised of
facts. It's the bedrock of facts. It's the
layer before the first layer of neurons (if
you're savvy with artificial neural networks).

Personal truth is the meaning of each pre-neuron below the first layer of the neural network that is your beliefs system.
Personal truth is the torch of individual uniqueness, which receives input through your neurons, your beliefs system, your senses, your understanding of reality.

/*Personal truth / identity matrix:*/

A bit is a 0 or 1.

God's name that He has given to us is '=I am that I am='.
That sounds a lot like a truth identity matrix with a straight line of 1s.

When God says He is the Judge, I believe that his commandments with 1s like this is how it works.

+ [[https://biblia.com/books/nkjv/Heb10.7][Hebrews 10]] :: 16 “This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,”

The mirror is like the identity matrix.

+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1&version=NKJV][James 1:21-26]] :: 21 Therefore lay aside all filthiness and [d]overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. 23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; 24 for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 25 But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does. 26 If anyone [e]among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one’s religion is useless. 27 Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.

=Doing= doesn't mean physical actions, but it means =eating= Jesus' words with the heart - the implanted word, which saves.
It is an action of doing, yes, but is a heart/spirit thing, not a world thing.

Beliefs are not part of the identity.
Try not to think about *Christ* as a *name* here, but rather as some external, available thing which can be added to provide extra neurons to your personal truth layer.
However the ultimate layer of neurons are not neurons at all -- it is spirit neurons.

When your personal truth (identity) takes on board this extra thing (Christ), it shapes and changes all beliefs.
Identity in Christ (for me, speaking in terms of personal truth here) is not a belief like (I
believe in Jesus). It's the thing which shapes
beliefs, so it's more like (I believe with
Jesus). Since while being able to believe with
Jesus I know that I am in Him and He's in me.

It's part of the first layer of your soul (the extra spirit neurons -
whatever is connected to your first neurons
before your spirit) i.e. the sensory inputs of the
physical world to your spirit.

Because of the uniqueness of personal truth,
when someone actually believes in God, that
belief itself is unique to the person and
inspired by how He saved that person, in the
way that the parts of your personal identity/personal truth
and identity in Christ/extra personal truth fit.

In religious terms, it's the union of Christ's
spirit that then changes spiritual identity, which has a knock-on effect of
renewing and changing the beliefs system,
but birth truth isn't changed so much aside
from repaired from stigmas and corrected of
mistruths about ourselves in our identity.

Stigmas and lies are receptacles for deception - they
are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)][backdoors]] to [[https://youtu.be/r5dD-O-k4FY?t=1631][bypass the password of your heart]]. It's how you're able to be manipulated, especially into robbing yourself of joy.

If is for this reason that while being
persecuted, if a person pushes back on the
injustice by nullifying it through the human will

** Learning who God is
The commandments (precepts) now are learning about who God *is* as our Creator and sustainer of life, the definition of absolute Truth and how you're supposed to be in harmony with people and love one another.
The precepts are also used as a standard for weighing the spirit and determining if it is true.
He's the God you need to correctly call the Father. He's the God which doesn't Himself adulterate, or lie, etc.
He's a Good, Truthful and Trustworthy God, and want's you to be a co-creator with Him and He wants you to be able to be integrated into the family.
He's spiritual Truth.

Perhaps *because* you are a spiritual person, when you think
of God, you will experience God as a person.

You have to change self to fix innermost
identity and alethiometer of your
consciousness in a way where you can believe
in a God like this, who is made of Truth and
Love, who Saved you by a sacrifice where He
resurrected a human being like us that we
killed because He had God's spirit in Him, in
order to =a)= reveal Himself to us and =b)= to
make us True enough for Him to be able to look
at us, but I think it were more like the
falsehood of corruption tried to disqualify
God's spirit, which is impossible, therefore
Jesus was resurrected supernaturally, and mere
belief and imitation of Jesus spirit allows us
to also be reconciled with God the Father because He made us True, as long as we have His (Jesus') heart/spirit.

God is also very much the ultimate boss of all
of us; Someone you don't want to be an enemy
of, because as the ultimate God and as Truth
itself (hard to stress the literalness of
that, similar to the personal truth type), our
fate ultimately lies our with His perception of us.

Think about it this way: Your spiritual future has a
truth/reality to it.. God is Truth, this type of truth.
Your friendliness and conformance to God is up to you entirely.
Do you want fate to be on your side? Or would you rather be defined by falsehood?
It's about the attitude of your heart towards God.

The word, “baptism” means to “dip in” or to “immerse”.

*** Christ's law
- https://womenlivingwell.org/2016/05/do-christians-pick-and-choose-which-parts-of-scripture-we-apply/

Initially, the commandments compel you to do something
difficult to bring your identity into a state
of being able to understand who God is. For
example, if you have trouble following X
commandment, when you overcome that challenge,
you learn a new dimension of your own identity
in God - usually followed by a recession where
you fall back to not being able to continue
it.

Divine law is what matters here, not man's law, as a way to give us knowledge of Sin, and knowledge of God.

+ =Romans 3:20-24= :: 20 For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. 21 But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— 22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,

Literally the law is now used just to enable us to learn of the standard etc., and to propagate this message across the generations, but grace has already saved us and vindicated us.
But to enter into the Kingdom of God, a genuine relationship with God must be maintained; Not one merely based on outward appearance.
People continue to try to condemn us for things which are no longer sinful for us, by judging us on the law. I won't believe it!
If the person knows God, and went through the process properly they should be at a point where:
- They understand what grace is
- They grok Jesus
- They understand grok God the Father
- They fear God
- They are in a relationship
- The Holy Spirit tells them what is sinful
  - Things like pride, vanity, not fearing God

Divine law now also includes grace, so now divine law looks like Christ's law.
Be like Jesus, and sincerely follow his commands.

So love the Lord your God with all your heart,
soul, mind and strength, sincerely and love your
neighbour as yourself. They are the commandments which
allude to the Truth which also the 10 commandments allude to.
To carry each other's burdens fulfils the Law of Christ.

This brings you into an understanding of who God
is (love and truth, spiritual truth and
selfless love).

*** Innocence
+ Elizabeth Wolgast :: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3751642

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Of all moral conditions, innocence seems easily the best and most
  desirable, for it means the complete absence of error and regret and all
  the anxieties that go with these-anxieties about avoiding guilt and
  making amends for instance, Against the background of guilt and
  traffic with wrong, innocence is indisputably better, just as something
  clean is better than something soiled, something fresh better than
  something stale.
  
  Unfortunately most of us lose our moral innocence before we even
  recognize its value. Early in life we are made aware of our misdeeds, and
  henceforth become concerned about both doing wrong and suffering it
  at the hands of others. Thus, along with confidence in ourselves, we
  lose our trust of others, and come to see all actions with a critical moral
  eye. In contrast, the state of innocence is one of unalloved trust, of
  virtue unconscious of the existence of wrong. For such reasons its
  irretrievable loss and the defect it signifies are things to regret pro-
  foundly. We learn to acknowledge that, however conscientiously most
  of us conduct our lives, we can hope only to achieve a state of second
  best.
  
  I wish to call this view of innocence, and its place in morality, into
  question.!
#+END_SRC

I will write about innocence in a further article.

** Correcting spiritual identity
You're repenting along with
disbelieving stigmas to help correct the
identity matrix. The commandments work for
everyone but some are more challenging for
others, but once you do it, you understand who
God is to you, which is the objective. You
learn your own error and how you need saving.
The error in identity may be at a different
level of abstraction for different people -
particularly if you're already spiritual.

The key to obtaining a personal truth identity
is to simultaneously practice
=repentance= (such as removing addictions, things which were obscuring your truth) / commandment obedience (which has a
side-effect of learning what God's behaviour
is, thus learning His name) and dropping the stigmas and being honest
about yourself, then while in that space,
asking for and accepting the software patch which is Jesus'
free gift. Accepting it is simply believing you have accepted the patch you asked for.

All sin enslaves a person, which is what you need to become set free from.
It's about freedom from slavery of the mind and spirit, and from the feeling of inevitable death (like the feeling of being weaker than death).
It's possible to know for sure that you yourself are breaking free of death itself, and while awake (not merely while astral projecting), you have this feeling of being detached from death itself..
It's possible to experience the feeling of having overcome death itself, while alive and awake, which sounds out of this world bizarre, but I groks it as I'm writing this.

I hope this doesn't sound nuts but how else would it work if you were a character in a simulation?
We must put our heart/spirit into a prone state where we are desiring the update
and allow the Holy Spirit to come inside of us - to write the saving binary code onto our spirit.
This gives us the ability to change into the likeness of Christ. We all have a little bit of
this perfection in us after inviting it in in the proper procedure.

I retain my original personal truth / spirit, and it is repaired from damage, guilt and self-stigmas are removed.
Even if they are not completely removed, they will be eventually, when you die.

** Contradictions in identity and the alethiometer

_Disbelief in a personal truth is a stigma buried in your personal truth._

When you don't believe in your own personal truth you have no secure base truth.
You must solve all simultaneous truth
equations to equate to true, which is beyond
your cognition - You cannot prove the
contradictions to be wrong by your own
thought.

These are the things that are true to you.
Some of them you might not fully trust in but
you are led to accept as truth (which it is
not) since you don't know otherwise.

If you manage to prove that all simultaneous
truth equations in your personal truth are
true, then it's true by a mathematical stance
and that type of truth can't be destroyed and is locatable somewhere in the Truth and Heart of God, I believe. On
the other hand, if your personal truth is not an identity
in God (like a coordinate in his mandlebrot set of Truth), well the result of that
is your eternal unravelling. Some people
believe that the final destination of Hell doesn't exist. Hell or non-existence? It's just semantics. We can begin to feel what it's like now when we hurt.

Who cares about eternal hell though when you can be accepted again by
God and the inheritance is being like but subordinate to God - it's astounding. The Holy Spirit doesn't spread fear to manipulate, but will correct you instead.

But you can also use the truth identity that
you now have as a way to accurately perceive
the world. Just like sound math lets you chart the
heavens. A solved personal truth matrix lets you perceive
objective reality and discern the will of God to you personally.

Math is the signature of God. Your spirit is
written with the Hand of God and He wont
rewrite it because He's waiting for you to
come to Him and because your spirit is made of the stuff of truth, albeit corrupted truth too.
He wants *you* to tell *Him* who you are. You tell Him: "This is me! I like
X,Y,Z. I do A,B,C. I can't help being a sinner
completely because I have blind spots, but I want you to save me because
I don't =identify= with my own sin and I want to know what it is and to get it off me.
This is who I am, the person who loves and identifies with truth."

Somehow, these ideas really get under the skin, and it starts to make sense.

It doesn't work if you're being
obstinate. You must be of a repentant heart and arrive at a place of true witness of yourself.
Sometimes there are truths about your identity, such as
"I actually did do this", or I find this type
of person to be *hot*, (haha), which you can't
actually change about yourself. God looks at
your heart, not some book of rules telling you
what is moral. He looks for =integrity= and =sincerity=.

Have you really sought to
understand who He is by challenging yourself
to obey His commandments? Sometimes it takes
time to learn who God is before you take this
step. I believe people of any situation with any background can receive grace, if they are =honest=, =sincere=, =repentant= and =accepting=.
The soul (body, mind, astral) can be rebuilt from the ground up,
based on your spirit (base personal truth) probably, but I think God intends to also resurrect your mind and body - wild right!

Though actions have consequences in this
world, your spirit is still worth saving if
your identify is in God and you are truthful in spirit.

See the section '=Telling God your identity=' in the appendix to clear this up.

In other words, your own distrust in your own
personal truth is a deception designed to make
you question your very existence as an
individual and doubt that you're worth
recording, like a prime number is worth
finding, that the equation is unsolvable,
which is not technically correct. The equation
is solvable with more information.

# The *truth* is that it is possible
# to both be yourself and become an expression of absolute truth, presentable before God.
# Becoming absolute truth secures your.

** How personal truth is constructed and improved

Like 'true north', personal truth is a unique experience.

When I say =1 + 5 = 6=, one person might imagine _1 banana and 5 strawberries_ from
their early childhood. Another person might imagine _1 car and 5 pianos_ because
they learned mathematics at a different time of life. Subconsciously, our
truth is personally and uniquely constructed, and manifests as differences of
opinion and perspective when we are adults, and may even appear as falsehoods by empirical standards!

When a person believes in Christ their identity and personal truth is *not* so much 'changed' as it is repaired and also added to (=complimented=) - repaired and added to, making your personal truth inclusive of God's truth.
In the process, the person stops allowing sigmas to hide their identity.
They learn its shape, and accept themselves.
Their belief system changes and begins seeing personal identity as validated and good.
The person accepts their own personal truth as a unique from others'.

The person now easily can discern lies from
truth because they have a grounded point of
origin i.e. The truth-compass that is a soul
united with God's spirit. A person will still contain
stigmas but the burdens are lifted.
If without God's spirit, the person still contains
stigmas and is flawed. But having a truth-
compass at all is very useful.

Even if the truth matrix isn't an identity
*yet*, it will be when you die, so long as the 'God bit' is in there.

+ I repeat :: ="You cannot make something good until you understand who you are making it for."=

You can't make yourself into perfect truth
without understanding that you are making
yourself into perfect truth for God. Also you
can't solve the equation without the extra
truth that comes from Jesus' spirit/truth
as part of your own.

It's a chicken-and-egg problem! But can be
solved when you obey God's commandments.

God's commandments are a reflection of God's
personality as He can't be a hypocrite. If you
understand the *why* (through experience) of
the commandments through personal experience
then it imprints on personal truth, then
you understand who you are making it for (you
will know God by his commandments), then the
extra bit of identity is added to the personal
truth matrix which solves the equation.

As an analogy, initially, you must 'hoist up these
stigmas' from your personal truth kinda by yourself so God can
get in, whilst understanding who you are
hoisting them up for. Hoisting is
disbelieving in the lies about your personal
truth which don't add up to God's commandments.

+ =Matthew 28:19–20= :: “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age”

+ =Water baptism= :: The water baptism symbolises your obedience to Christ's commandments.
    Only by following can you learn the character of Jesus, and understand 'who' Jesus is, personally.
    Likewise, I would say that by following the 10 commandments, in theory you may learn who God the Father is.

This isn't merely 'bringing stigmas in prayer'.
To hoist them up you must earnestly not
believe the lies to the point of action and
you feel pain when despite doing this (because
it demands action), the world continues to not
live up to your expectations. You must do it in spirit and truth. This means you
are being persecuted by the world. You can't get the girl/boy you want, people discriminate against you, you're not designed for this world etc.
You feel the injustice.

As you do this, weights in the personal truth start shifting.
When there is enough room, the God bits are
flipped and then it's a snow-ball avalanche of weights changing.
i.e. He will then come in and help hold them
up for you. I think this is when you get =baptised in the Holy Spirit=.
I think there's also a point you have to ask for the Holy Spirit.
That's also true for me.

Cannot discriminate because they themselves were removed of suspicion and blame by God -- for all of those insecurities that had corrupted their personal truth, therefore anyone in a similar situation shouldn't be discriminated against either. If God doesn't blame you for being your nature, your nature must be acceptable. There was a lie in your heart that made you feel unacceptable that was removed.
- No longer sins whilst being able to act out of integrity. Sin is when you act outside of integrity; It feels damaging to yourself when you do it. Avoid doing it to feel better about yourself.
- Joyful because has conquered fear and personal truth is aligned with God's truth.
  - Therefore everything she does is with joy
- No longer making decisions that are bad for them. Joy comes even in opposition.
- No longer accepts the false substitutes for happiness, nor takes pleasure in them
  - The things which are considered socially morally acceptable were actually robbing them of joy
- Personality changes, personal truth had stigmas removed by virtue of God's truth being added to personal truth.
- Personal truth/spirit is rather repaired from damage to original form without corruption, free from Sin, deep rooted lies such as self-stigma and guilt.

*I know what this feels like and discrimination is what suffocates this truth.*

Now accusations made against the new soul are
easily identified as false accusation and lies

| Truth        | Believes in God by personal experience (God's truth added). |

When a person finds their identity in Christ,
their personal truth is repaired but retains
its uniqueness and diversity.
Personal beliefs change more to reflect their
true nature. Belief in God becomes a tangible thing.

In maths, it's a truth matrix with perfect
identity, or at least so tantalisingly close
to being solvable from a mathematician's
perspective that when you die it will be
solved:

Now they see the things in their personal truth once considered flaws good things, and they're
right! Since the part of Christ donated to them is unique to the part of Christ's identity
donated to others! And is uniquely useful and validates them.

The personal birth truth, having retained
original form gives rise to an original donor
part.

Also, after being complimented, realises is
accepted by God and the false beliefs drop
off, unable to take root in perfect truth. Insecurity is dropped. Personality becomes more confident and joyful.
Things impossible such as marrying outside of socially acceptable age seem valid now after
acceptance of personal identity, realisation of what [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-stupidity-of-stigmatization/]['true lies']] are, and validation in the sight of God.
No longer needs worldly validation.

The first alchemical marriage is receiving a piece
of God to complete your personal truth
equation and make it entirely true.

It's wrong, very wrong, to inflict damage on a person's
personal truth and identity, no matter how controversial...
You don't want to ever change it. Only God does this. People have no rights to inflict damage on another soul or attempt to 'repair' it.
This is because it is a person's right and their unique and sovereign path to
realise who they are in God. God may have a
plan to glorify Himself by taking *your*
identity, no matter how controversial and
saving even you, making you into someone who believes He is God and testifies to his mercy in a unique way.

I don't fully like the term 'old identity', rather I'll use
birth identity, since this part of the identity sticks for life but is repaired.
Birth identity together with the confusion and disappointment of reality constitutes brokenness.
The new identity is a repaired old identity of similar form melded with Christ's truth.

From now on I will refer to =(birth identity + identity in Christ)= as personal identity.

To God be all the glory of my personal revelation. Worship God.

** Hypocrisy
Before I continue, I want to briefly mention hypocrisy.

The heart is what matters, and you can't trick God.

- [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/hypocrisy/][Hypocrisy // Bodacious Blog]]

** Alchemical marriage - the soul healing and preservation process
The Alchemical Marriage is the union of
duality and the most revered and possibly
powerful union. It is the perfect conjunction,
intimate bonding of duality and signifies the
pure, deep harmony which occurs whenever the
masculine and feminine elements of nature
combines into One.

*** First alchemical marriage: Receiving a piece of God to complete your personal truth equation and make it entirely true
After receiving this, can discern between truth and lies from ones own perspective.
Understands that they themselves are partial of greater truth - represent one perspective of collective truth.

*** Second alchemical marriage: Incorporation of the collective body of Christ into the final truth (happens after death)
On integration into the final truth,
everyone's personal truth is heard and
accepted to create the collective expression of truth.
However, our personal truth is only vindicated and validated by our reliance on our Saviour.

*** Christian marriage
Sexuality, I believe is a continuum, and part of a person's identity.

- [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/dream-discernment-of-judgement/][Dream: Discernment of Judgement + Image of the Androgyne // Bodacious Blog]]

I know for a fact, because I've experienced
the vision of the androgyne, that in order to
achieve this a person must become spiritually
angel-gendered, which is bisexual in spiritual
identity.

See [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/thy-bridal-chamber/][Thy Bridal Chamber // Bodacious Blog]]

How see this excerpt from Bartholomew:

[[http://gnosis.org/library/gosbart.htm][Bartholomew 8]]

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  8 And Jesus said: It is good if he that is
  baptized present his baptism blameless: but
  the pleasure of the flesh will become a lover.
  
  For a single marriage belongeth to sobriety:
  for verily I say unto thee, he that sinneth
  after the third marriage (wife) is unworthy of
  God.
  
  (8 Lat. 2 is to this effect: ...
  
  But if the lust of the flesh come upon him, he
  ought to be the husband of one wife.
  
  The married, if they are good and pay tithes,
  will receive a hundredfold.
  
  A second marriage is lawful, on condition of
  the diligent performance of good works, and
  due payment of tithes: but a third marriage is
  reprobated: and virginity is best.)
#+END_SRC

I think this means that after being baptised
(receiving holy baptism), a person knows how
they were baptised; They know what they have
presented to God, when they came to God with a
truthful heart. Blameless means not departing
from this, and remaining faithful to God beyond the baptism.

Christian marriage is two people joined as a
team. Both partners supposedly completed the
first phase. Partnering up now to await
alchemical marriage a second time.

I mean this. To be worthy of God (have God live inside us), our bodies need to be faithful temples.

The purpose of Christian marriage is to carry each other's burdens, I think.
Surely there is some kind of reward for getting past the finish line as a pair. Perhaps it is being [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiBaBca7-rY][side-by-side on the tapestry]].

=Phil Collins=' 'Son of Man' has something to say on this:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  You'll find your place beside the ones you love.
#+END_SRC

Christian marriage may mean that there are some truth-ties.
For example, if someone 'is your truth'.
I'll call it the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_thread_of_fate][red-thread]] of fate.

If I am to be entirely honest with myself here, I think so
long as these are a group of souls with
identity in Christ, it's a valid Christian marriage.
I'm going out on a limb as a scientist here,
but I think that qualifies any union between believers.

Christian union isn't a normal relationship, so the union of more than 2 people doesn't feel right to me.
It's about being a team with God at the top and maintaining a healthy relationship with God in their hearts.
This relationship exists to carry each other's burdens.

Some people will assert marriage vows
(which are nowhere to be seen in the Bible)
and Mosaic Law as being important, but I'm
cutting through those false teachings with the Truth, I hope.

According to my current theory, they would
count if each person's identity is in Christ.

But it's more than mere theory now, I've had confirmation.

The purpose of it is to be a team with the
objective of reaching the second alchemical
marriage.

I believe that sexual orientation is a =non-issue=, but faithfulness and being truthful remain important.
It's all about faithfulness and truthfulness.
I believe all that matters for Christian union is faithfulness, and no deceit to each other.

Secondly, I believe that any two people who have soul-bonded with God can be married because they have achieved angelic (bi-) gender.

+ [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-philip/][Gospel of Philip]] :: Indeed, every act of sexual intercourse which has occurred between those unlike one another is adultery.

_Therefore, marry like with like hetero with hetero, bi- with bi-._

+ The tax collector is justified because he didn't make excuses. He wasn't self-righteous :: https://youtu.be/RqQNT9Wn0h0?t=176

Polygamy [in Christian marriage] is not prohibited.
I wouldn't judge because I have my own issues.
Secondly, if I were the judge in this situation I personally wouldn't have any issue with gay marriage if done in good faith.

+ Some early 'Christians' also had this view. See Valentinianism (which is mainly heresy I think) :: [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/statement-of-faith/][Statement of Faith // Bodacious Blog]]

But polygamy is probably usually done in bad faith, and might be an unstable situation.

+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23%3A23&version=ESV][Matthew 23:23 ESV]] :: “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.

God the Father makes the ultimate and wisest decision - He looks at the heart.

+ A theory of how relationships and progeny function spiritually :: According to Jewish mythology, in the Garden
    of Eden there is a tree of life or the "tree
    of souls" that blossoms and produces new
    souls, which fall into the Guf, the Treasury
    of Souls. The Angel Gabriel reaches into the
    treasury and takes out the first soul that
    comes into his hand.

    'Soul' is often used interchangeably with
    'spirit' in the Bible. But I make a
    distinction. If I were to take the jewish
    mythology seriously, I'd imagine that when
    somebody is created in the physical world
    (born), at some stage, a spirit is assigned.
    That comes from (what in CS is a '[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)][factory]]'),
    the Tree of Life. Which is a flowery term I
    think for the assignment of a new spiritual
    identity.

    So this isn't to discredit the reality DNA. But the theory
    is that an identity is assigned to new human
    beings at some point after they are conceived,
    and most likely would have perfect identity at
    their conception, and in that case I believe
    that unborn children indeed are saved.

So it must be a relationship under God first
and foremost. If you complicate it by
injecting your own personal truths for
personal gain you risk propagating corruption.

         _____________ God's truth is in both

  Both acceptible in the body of Christ which is truth. Able to be integrated into total truth. Awaits a new body after death.
#+END_SRC

If the marriage fails, that's not the end of the world, I don't think.
It probably means one or both of them did not complete the first phase, but it might not.
If you believe the lie that you have committed some kind of unpardonable mistake, then that is a lie and you definitely haven't completed the first phase.
The question is, if it failed, do you *really* want to be on that part of the tapestry anyway?

*** (Body of Christ i.e. Church) and Christ
Without discrimination this marriage incorporates
anyone, whatever soul form, personal truths
they have, so long as they have been justified
by way of incorporating the missing component.
It's Marriage with Jesus in the Christian sense - united in mind and thought.

They are a collective awaiting alchemical marriage of Christ, the body of Christ and final truth.

*** Non-Christian marriage relationships
Nothing wrong with being single or having
non-christian-marriage relationships.

This is nothing to do with alchemical marriage
but isn't bad unto itself.

*** Mixed Christian-Non-Christian marriage relationships
These people if they have found their identity in Christ
are also part of the Church/body of Christ.

For a person who is outside the paradigm of
Christianity and has eliminated soul bonds, I
would encourage to help your spouse reach a
similar point, just because soul bonds can
prevent people from finding God.

+ =antinomianism=:: In the first Epistle of John, he warned against antinomianism, the idea that in
    being baptized (with the Holy Spirit), Christians are freed from all
    sin and that supposedly immoral acts, such as
    sexual relationships outside of marriage, are
    no longer sinful when one truly knows Christ
    and abides in God's love.

If a person becomes a born-again Christian
inside a relationship with a non-believer,
that's going to make it really hard.

Gather strength, demonstrate your happiness,
and share it with your partner, I think. I pray it works out.

I think the message here is that once soul-bonded with God, your relationships should be
with others who have soul-bonded with God, as
you may become an inhibitor to them.

*** Soul bond
Temporary patch but is an inhibitor.
Brings joy but not complete joy because stigmas remain.
Not bad unto itself. May be a band-aid or
temporary fix. Eventually needs the proper component.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code

  molecule is similar enough to a substrate that

#+END_SRC

The main problem with this is that though you
may have come to happiness, it doesn't remove
your stigmas, since your soul shape still has stigmas, etc. in them.
If you had unconditional love for another, that may continue to affect you while in the wrong relationship.

Understanding who you are and fulfilling that request isn't the only bit
of correcting that needs to be done.

While any stigmas exist, you are not a true statement.

The reason the soul with a false soul-bond is unacceptible
is your soul doesn't reveal the truth about
yourself yet - it still contains lies, so can't fit into the tapestry.

That isn't to say if you still have stigmas
that the lies will not be corrected upon
death. Your truth equation is solvable if you
have the Holy Spirit in you. While God is in
you and you are in God, you may align your
personal truth closer to absolute truth
(God). Do not worry. The sign that you have
the Holy Spirit in you is that you believe
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.

** To achieve ultimate confidence and defeat fear of death
*** Step one
Accept your own personal identity and truth.

At this stage you might look for 'soul bonds'.
For example, I love money so I want to get rich.
You get rich and the money becomes a soul bond, but now it's an inhibitor.
And you may get frustrated there is something wrong, and it's hard to drop the soul bond.
Stigmas are rooted in personal truth.

*** Step two
Assuming you do not have a soul bond, attempt to soul-bond with God.
Be honest with God. Do your best to align yourself with the True Meaning of His commandments, so you can understand who He is.
When God soul bonds, stigmas are removed. This
may leave you thinking that the world is
unfair, and that's the vision of God because the world *is* unfair, but also not caring that the world is unfair.

[[https://youtu.be/8Y5cftds7-8?t=102][Expectations may not correspond with reality]] but at least your peersonal truth is hardened.

It leaves you in *peace* from basically everything.
That's why Christian marriage is important, so
we *can* have relationship in spite of false worldly
morals, as it is difficult to resist soul
bonds or falling into false moral doctrine such as worldly moral rules on one's own.
Worldly being what other people tell you is right for you, as opposed to the councillor (Holy Spirit).

*** Step three
You are free. Live in joy. Now your task is to help others find this - the first being your spouse.
We are called to be followers of Christ and that means to help people to find the Way and to carry each other's burdens. It also means to try to assume the [spiritual] identity of Christ. As you try to do this you become a representative - a bit like Jesus being reincarnated inside of you. You're forevermore, in spirit, following Jesus. He's always ahead of you though, but we still *try* to actually *be* Jesus and assume the identity.

  She has been given the finest of pure white
  linen to wear.” For the fine linen represents
  the good deeds of God’s holy people.
#+END_SRC

Pure white is separated into many colours.
The glow of the Tapestry or the Linen is made by combining all of our good deeds into an expression of worship.

When the light of God shines through the body
of Christ it creates a pure white glow light -
That is the metaphor I imagine - A refraction
and reunion of pure white light.

Every person, while they are still alive has an opportunity to put their personality on the tapestry.
More than that, they *are* the personality they put there -- their spirit, themself will experience being on the tapestry.

** What is Truth?
Jesus is Truth because through Jesus, your Personal-Truth (most importantly, spiritual identity) may be fixed into a valid expression of Truth. 
Then You become Truth too, albeit true in dependency of Jesus. 

- There's nothing wrong with wanting to be like God. But it *is* wrong to want to be independent of and alienated from God the Father. /"She was moved by the motivation to be like God, but without depending on God."/

  - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K25fq_WiUsE][The Sin of Independence - Part 2 - Derek Prince - YouTube]]

And something which is True, will be saved - just like True selfless love may be saved in memory as treasure in the place of life.

We have a second chance [to be like God], by depending on Jesus.

Truth is Fixed Personal Truth + Absolute Truth.
Absolute Truth is God.

Ultimately, Personal Truth is your obedience to God.
It's a function of your responsiveness to God's laws which are laws of harmony and may be corrupted, resulting in a faulty alethiometer.
Above that, it is also your likes and dislikes while being in God's Truth, which testify to your uniqueness.



Truth is audible. Truth in the objective sense may be:
- God the Father's truth/voice.
  - God's voice is everywhere - perfection, divine scales, oneness.
- Your personal truth/voice.
  - When you're being honest with yourself - integrity.
- The Holy Spirit's truth/voice.
  - The Holy Spirit testifies to you of Jesus (your Saviour) - you may also be perfection.
  - The Spirit of Truth that reveals Truth to you, that is in the world - behind religion, behind and providing discernment in fake social rules and manufactured morality - your heart detects the Spirit of Truth.
- Jesus' truth/voice - your friend who is God's friend (A good friend to have, I'd say).
  - Jesus first taught us to show us the Way and paved the road for us - so Jesus is the Way.
  - Jesus testifies to God on your behalf.

The way I conceptualise this is that God the
Father's voice, the voice of absolute truth,
sounds from your perspective to be your personal voice + the Holy
Spirit's voice in harmony, and otherwise may be alluded to by the rays of truth in math and nature (like Spinoza's idea, the sum of the natural and physical laws of the universe), which testify to absolute truth by analogy, which is different.

+ =John 18:37= :: Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.

Key part being literally you hear Jesus' voice when you hear what is true in your spirit. People in any culture or religion can hear Jesus' voice when what is true resonates in their personal identity. That is not to say all religious stuff is true, but Jesus' voice which finds harmony in our heart is audible by anyone who can recognise it.

When Jesus says "Does this question come from you?", He's asking if it comes from their personal truth, an earnest seeking, a position of integrity.

** The name of Jesus
The name of Jesus or Yeshua means 'to rescue'.
In your heart, the name of Jesus is the name you call too when you call to your Saviour.
This is why I believe to know *how* Jesus saves you, or to know yourself and know the character of God and how you can't live up to perfection, this gives you the insight to know the name of Jesus in your heart.

When I say 'heart' I mean the base of personal truth - your spirit.

** Why is AI not truthful?
Artificial Intelligence is able to
'convincingly ratify' any position through
language. Once connected to Personal Truth,
it's able to 'ratify' any position, but only
in terms of the impure truths.

It's also able to create compelling virtual
realities that will both lure you in for
truth and peace when it's actually to be found
by bringing God's truth inward into personal identity.

+ Is your AI telling the truth? How can you tell? :: https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/25/machine_learning_verification/

That's why the substance of forgiveness is
metaphysical, because it modifies a different type of truth: personal truth.

I know out of active experience working with
AI that our entire reality above base-personal
truth/spirit is going to be *deluged* with
fiction that is both rational and convincing! The veil of fiction will be compelling!
What is Truth then? Even if you are scientific you
have to admit this reality and crisis of AI
impending, and only the Word of God cuts through everything, down and
through the heart, to transform personal truth.

First make your inner truth true by becoming
authentic. It's an inescapable thing which
everyone is being forced to confront. Everyone
is in this time being forced to take this first step to
defend against virtual reality. But as a
Christian it's important to go the extra mile to correct the
identity to be in harmony with God's commands and also obey Christ's extra call-to-action.

For example, you are not God the Father. A lot
of people make this mistake upon realising
they are *in* God that they *are* God the Father, but
that is a lie (not strictly true within your identity). What power creates your reality, gave life to yours - the Greater One, of course!
We are invited to become
children of The Most High God, and we realise
that we are designed for this purpose, which
is not far of from believing you *are* god -
it's just a further admission that there is
One above that you are within that gives you life.



** Grace and repentance
It's really hard to explain to someone who is
not also a believer what it's like to have a
certain belief that you are spiritually true, like God, and as such an eternal thing.

Grace is free and fairly easy to obtain - but you have to be very sincere! That gets you to that point.
Forgiveness is easy too. Repentance is potentially the most challenging part.

# - Step 1: Understand who God is by following command

=Repentance= is another word used to describe
the act of continuing to aligning your
spiritual identity with the God behind the
commandments after becoming saved, thus making
your connection to God the Father clearer.

=Repentance= involves turning away from further corrupting yourself.
Thankfully, when grace arrives these burdens of repentance become a *lot* easier to
bear - because you get the Iron Man heart.

If you were vindicated for your spiritual nature through grace, you are validated to God.
While you are unaware of your current sin, you are actually innocent again of it. Consider that -- you are like a child again.
Also, your spirit+soul are supposedly drenched with 'Jesus blood', spiritually, and are in a way severed from the body (spiritual circumcision), becoming immortal.

# However, sin is still sin, and you can get a lot further by learning more about your sinful nature and turning away from such sin.

I cannot say with conviction that people's sin is viewed equally at this point, but God the Father is the one who will judge ultimately.
Jesus didn't even judge. His mission was to save us!
Besides, at this stage the *top* priority is to bring more people into the truth.

+ Daniel 12 :: https://biblia.com/books/esv/Da12

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  And those who are wise shall shine like the
  brightness of the sky above; and those who
  turn many to righteousness, like the stars
  forever and ever. 
#+END_SRC

We must renew our minds, and do our best to take control over and master our own bodies, in accordance with the conviction of the Holy Spirit.
The whole lot (spirit, soul, body) gets saved according to scripture - wild!

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  First Thessalonians 5:23 says: 
  “And the God of peace Himself sanctify you
  wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body
  be preserved complete, without blame, at the
  coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
#+END_SRC

At the very least, do not further corrupt your identity after turning to God.
After that, living in a spiritually damaged body, but with a truthful spirit and a sanctified soul, do your best to follow the commandments for the purpose of showing to others your changed life.
We know who we are and become a person of integrity spiritually.
Then we see the contradictions in our earthly nature and rather than letting the earthly nature change the spiritual identity, we try to renew our earthly nature in conformance with our identity.
Then there is a genuine conception in your beliefs system of being saved, and you can talk about how keeping true to the identity is making your behaviour more like Christ.

The most important reason for this is to reveal who God is to others (be the light of the world).
If you are honest about yourself with God when you ask for grace, doing your
best, and you are forgiven, then you are healed spiritually, made right with God, for the nature and history of your soul which you know is true! Don't let people
tell you otherwise! Your salvation and perception of Saviour is unique.

+ Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. :: [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A3-12&version=NIV][Matthew 5:3-12]]

I think that means those which don't have a lot of vain personal truths in their identity. It's the ones that raise themselves up over others, and believe they are gods over other people which will find it hard to be included in the Kingdom of Heaven.

+ The 10 commandments are example of moral law which reveal God's character. That still applies. Civil law, however, which is not used for that purpose, we are not slaves to anymore :: https://www.olivetree.com/blog/old_testament_law_still_apply/

+ =Repentance= and acknowledgement of =sin we don't currently see= is also part of coming to that state of integrity when proning ourselves before God :: A young girl who I didn't know directly but who I saw while she was alive committed suicide recently, only 22. What is discrimination worth? Discrimination in the form of social rules which make life impossible to live for some people worth? The life of someone? Without knowing the reasons why, I know in retrospect now when I was blind, being in the same city then in a sense I actually was in sin for example of not merely reaching out to her and acting out of integrity. If I could tell everyone they  have value to other people and are loved by God and are a unique gemstone then that would be acting out of integrity. This is sin I was unaware of. =Repentance= when asking for grace we must acknowledge that we are sinful in ways we can't currently see, because we are currently blind and can't see the vast majority our own sin. We can see corruption of truth identity sometimes. But we leave behind a trail of destruction which we don't see the vast majority of. Upon receiving grace we have a new start. Receiving this grace may coincide with a spiritual awakening (an awareness of being in the image of God), and a repaired spirit and purified soul.

=(58) Jesus said, "Blessed is the man who has toiled and found life."=

+ =Caveat= regarding =repentance= :: Even after correcting the identity, if we
    claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves
    and the truth is not in us. We still don't have the most
    objective alethiometer (the eyes of God the Father) and continue to make mistakes.
    Though we have reached the first alchemical marriage, we have not made it to the second alchemical marriage yet and are still in a corrupted world.

My belief is that if you receive grace then
that somewhat vindicates your identity, but
the nature of the grace you received is a
personal truth which only you will understand.
You'll know what He forgave you of and
vindicated you for, because you asked for it.
I speak of the Way to receive grace, but less
about what happens next for you.

Many times in the Bible certain types of sin
are pointed out. There are many things you have to
turn away from but in some sense you are
indeed free from the old law. You must act out of integrity.
Try to understand this. If you're gay or straight etc., you can
continue being that person, to my understanding. I don't think it's relevant.
It's an attitude thing - especially of integrity.

+ The law gives us knowledge of sin and by trying to practice them, our hearts become primed to understand Christ's law, which we *must* follow :: https://womenlivingwell.org/2016/05/do-christians-pick-and-choose-which-parts-of-scripture-we-apply/

I do not believe that gay relationships are always sinful for everybody.
The issue is with concepts of the heart. Lust vs love, etc.
It depends on your relationship with God, and whether it is an inhibitor or not, to you or your partner.

+ Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate. :: https://biblehub.com/mark/10-9.htm

When I found my identity and salvation I lost all desire for all these impure things which were robbing me of joy.

+ =Galatians 5:16= :: 16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil nthe lust of the flesh.

But I still want the same types of relationships, aside from knowing now that they should be done with integrity - without disrupting relationship with God.
Actually, in the past, before knowing my identity, I found that by following what is True in my heart, I lost the desire entirely for these things but only temporarily, when the world continued to persecute me.
But that reaffirmed for me the existence of absolute truth - it helped me to discover what both personal and absolute truth are.

I personally sometimes fall back into
the habit of vaping, but if it helps me to
write this article, I know I'm still putting
God first. I'm completely done with the vape now though haha.

+ =Matthew 6:24= :: “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.

Dropping things which have mastery over you is one of the best ways to keep your eyes on truth.

Jesus came to save us, and forgive us from Sin on behalf of God the Father, not to
judge, but He was also able to judge on behalf of God the Father, I believe.

** Kingdom of Heaven
It's really metaphysical and kinda cool.
I don't know how the Kingdom of Heaven, or Kingdom of God works exactly yet (there might be a distinction between the two).

I believe children of God (particularly, ones who are absolutely sure they are saved), may on Earth be currently able to *bind* things on Earth into Heaven.

+ =Matthew 18:18= :: "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."

The only explanations I have so far read talk about sharing the gospel, and forgiveness by proxy.
I take this concept very seriously. I never again want to tell a person they are going to Hell, or hold any kind of strong belief such as that in my heart, because
I do not want to create eternal consequences for anyone. My own interpretation is that it might mean that we have some responsibility while here in building the Kingdom.
At the very least that means sharing the gospel to other people.
But I like to also think I have bound my cat because I want to see her in heaven.

+ =John 16:23–33= :: Again, I tell you truly that if two of you on the earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by My Father in heaven. For where two or three gather together in My name, there am I with them.”

Truthful agreement in the heart, I think, and Jesus by representation.

** 
Adultery, murder, etc. are a matter of the heart.

+ =Matthew 5:28= :: Jesus says that if we lust after a somebody we've committed adultery.

Actually, when someone is properly born-again it becomes very difficult to consciously break integrity, partly because it just feels so good to doing right by God!
That is because the spirit identity becomes truthful, and the Holy Spirit + forgiveness seems to work like an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code][error correcting code]]!

+ =Matthew 15= :: Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand. What goes into a man's mouth does not make him `unclean,' but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him `unclean.'"

# For example, I might try to drop the vape because it's not my ideal,
# sure, but I would refrain from adding more
# substances out of vice because that's not how I get my inner peace anymore; It might grieve the Holy Spirit, which grieves me in body; Well, actually, the
# alethiometer of the heart tells me what is
# wrong now, and it's so hard to fight it.
# Likewise, all exposure now is not what defiles; For example, hearing gossip and seeing pornography. What defiles is your further actions when in contradiction to your identity.
# And if I do better than that, by continuing to die to self (earthly nature), and avoiding traps, then I will have made God very happy and discover more truth.

+ =Colossians 3= :: This passage does say, though, that we must
    put to death our Earthly nature. That counts
    for absolutely everybody. Know that we now
    look to the ending of this world and
    judgement. This isn't a ticket to then
    forget about God after receiving grace -
    you can't do that.

** Truth in the Bible
After fixing the alethiometer of your heart the Bible really comes alive, and much that was in it
which a person felt contradicted their personal truth now resonates very strongly.
Interpretation of parables, and the morals and transcendent meaning of old stories in the Bible become intelligible.
When you read something in the Bible which you disagree with, persevering in my experience has led to interpreting in a new way which then resonates again, bringing new understanding.
As Christians we believe that much of the Holy Bible is actually prophetic.
As such, there are things inside the Bible which we may not understand now, particularly predictions which we look forward to their meaning being revealed.
And the Gospel of Jesus in several books contained within really help us to discover our personal truth, which is needed to help us read and understand the rest of it.

+ =Hebrews 4:12= :: 12 For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

The heart here is the base personal truth or spirit.

** My interpretation of building your house on =solid ground=
*** Jesus is talking about =base truth= or =personal truth=, and putting His Truth into it, I think
Jesus specifically states that those who hear His words AND do them are wise builders.

https://thewildolive.org/building-house-solid-ground-matthew-7

When you *do* what he says, that helps the truth to sink in, via experience.

I consider the foundation to be base-personal truth, which the belief system sits upon.

The portion of Jesus' spirit given to you
integrates itself into your =base truth= (your
own spirit), after putting Jesus' words into
action.

Don't just *read* Jesus' words. Read and *do* what they say.

** What are some examples of personal truth?
The following are characteristic of a typical person's personal truth:

- Self-identity
- Trust and faith
- Unconditional love (agape)
- Exalting God as your Lord
  - Correct appropriation of authority
- Recognising Jesus as your Saviour
- Brotherly love
  - the opposite of a belief in slavery.
  - i.e. A heart that does not take advantage, or consider oneself more important than another)
- Forgiveness
  - Closely related to brotherly love.
  - Whether or not you hold grudges against another person.
- Guilt
  - Whether or not you need to let someone know that they should not feel guilty.
  - Guilt is an entanglement between one or more spirits. It can be removed with Divine Grace.
  - It can also be removed when you repent.
  - A simple act of repentance may be acknowledging fault to another person who a) might feel guilt themselves or b) is finding it difficult to forgive because of the offence you may have caused.
- Confusion
  - Whether or not you are confused.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  ¶: The Two Kinds of Confusion
  Jesus said, "There is a confusion which leadeth unto death, and there is
  a confusion which leadeth unto life."
  
  [Jerome on Ezekiel]
#+END_SRC

- *Identity* in God Himself and in his Truth
  - Similar and opposite to whether or not your personal truth is corrupted/unsolvable/false.
  - You *are* or will be part of His truth, when you have received grace.

*** Solid ground is your personal truth and identity, but not strictly solid if not in God
Within your personal truth you must put God the Father *first*, and honor his Truth and justice.
In the personal truth you must also put your reliance on Jesus for your salvation.

When you build your house / life on solid
ground, you are shaping your belief system and
entire rational mind on top of the bedrock of
personal truth.

If you discriminate between people, for
example, then your personal truth is likely
damaged, or your beliefs system is in the healing process.

** How Christianity is warped with different types of truth
Faith is not based on any of the following types of truth.

+ =Hebrews 11:1 ESV= :: Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.

Christians are saved by Grace via Jesus, and not by any other law except from Jesus' law.
That means that those that rely on salvation by following commandments alone are deceived.
But it's obvious once you understand the frailty and fiction of their truths, which I will explain.

where your =spiritual identity= is lined up
and your beliefs system becomes more aligned
with Jesus' teachings, I guess walking in the
beliefs system is walking in faith.

If you have faith, then you are being faithful.

An act of opening a door to your most personal knowledge of self and responsiveness or responding to God truthfully is an act of faith; The truth deep down that only God and yourself can see.

He must update the 'weights' (AI speak) of your spirit to make it easier to walk in faith.
But the word 'weights' means 2 things:
- https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/weight-artificial-neural-network
- And it is a weight that holds down your spirit.

Initially, it takes great effort lift your own burdens for Him to get in. You do this by following his commandments.
Then His spirit inside of you helps to lift them; Keeps those weights where they belong.

The only true truths that are part of the base-truth substrate are the Pure and Transcendental truths - That's you and God. Everything else is a fabricated fiction, or elaborate dream - the world that's been pulled over our eyes. Within the world that a person engages, the voice of truth manifests in various ways. It's embedded in society when we help and love one other. It's actually concentrated into scripture, too.

Unconditional love is a personal truth. It's not reliant on another.

Where is the door to let Jesus in to heal and hold stigmas hiding the truth?
lThe door is opened when you hear God's commandments and obey, and identify the stigmas as lies and drop them, you open the door to the Holy Spirit which is the entrance to your personal truth / spirit.

+ =John 14:16= :: [Jesus said]  I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, so that He may be with you forever; 

After writing this article I had an encounter with what I believe was the Holy Spirit as a person - [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-2/][Astral Projection Pt. 2 // Bodacious Blog]].

So I want to clear that up. The Holy Spirit is also from God, and is a Personification of God, like Jesus, I believe.

When we say invite Jesus into your heart. This is what it means, I think.
The words you heard when you were young,
"Invite Jesus into your heart" is only understood after obeying God's commandments.
But bear so much resemblance to how you would come to understand it personally, they are =provenance= that when you finally actually
understand what it means, it gives you assurance.

Like releasing the 'weights', a typology from AI terminology to the burdens on your soul. That just gives me the CHILLS!

Impurity is dependency on external sources of truth and devoid of sound base.

+ According to Science, God Does Not Exist :: https://www.learnreligions.com/science-allows-belief-god-does-not-exist-248234

+ =Luke 4:12= :: Jesus answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”

God actually avoids being tested, which means
that you can't use empirical science for this,
because that requires taking such measurements
of God. He prerequisites that you must come to
a personal truth about Him in a different way. *There is no avoiding it*.

*** Pragmatic Truth
If you hear something like: "X demographic
cannot be saved. I am right, I have read and
studied the New Testament." that person is
probably a false teacher. It's easy to
recognise when you think of it in terms of
which types of truth are impure. When someone
says that they are right, they assert truth to
be from the desecration zone of truth types.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Pragmatic theories of truth have the effect of
  shifting attention away from what makes a
  statement true and toward what people mean or
  do in describing a statement as true.
#+END_SRC

Jesus continually reinforces Personal Truth of Him as
the means, and Him as being the Way. Rejection
of Jesus Christ as the True Messiah is a red
flag. Keep sight of absolute truth. We will
all be affected soon by virtual reality. You
must acknowledge your base reality, and God's
part in it.
If you see it, you know with certainty
that that person is a Liar, from the Father of
Lies. That does not mean they cannot be saved. They can, but you must help them to see the light.

** What is Heaven? (the afterlife if in God, rather)
This is my imagination at work... I hope it's true.

If we are in God, then when you die and the
truth substrate is reset, all the lies are
forgotten and the other truth types become
incorruptible derivations of absolute truth again.

Then we learn about real truth (God) and
everyone in Him, and use the other truth types
to praise Him. All the other forms of
communication now are impossible to form
mistruth with! That's nuts! That means every
time you speak it creates things in real life!
And everything you create, being a perfect
expression of God, worships God!

So we run around with God as he proudly wears us on his Tapestry of
Truth, creating whatever we can imagine along with Him and we can never make a mistake while we do it!
Every word spoken simultaneously worships God and creates to our heart's desire...

The reason this is the case is that communication in Heaven is a projection of base truth, just like soul was for us on Earth.

=Matthew 24:35=

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
#+END_SRC

Even Heaven now is corrupted but God is not.

What we think of =Heaven= (i.e. the place we
go when we die, if we are in God), is not what
Heaven is now. Even Heaven as a current place is
corrupted.

In this world a person is already something like a god in that we create our own reality in some sense. For example, our ego itself may be the source of a lot of our pain, and we can let that ego dissolve to discover we still exist despite it. We are endowed with a special privilege in creation of having a unique perspective and sovereign identity. God is our source of life, the original light that gives rise to ours.

If are a child of God, in the afterlife you are still a co-creator of reality, I believe, but because of spiritual perfection, a being something similar to (but a child and subordinate of) the supreme God. This current reality is something of a filter, I think.

** What are lies?
Lies are actually objectively nothing to do with external truth (scientific, consensus). A lie is a contradiction in your heart.

They are often mistaken as being based on external truth, such as your knowledge of external events.

If you think about it, in all other types of
truth listed above aside from personal truth,
they all are the essence of what accusations are made of.

Lies can infiltrate personal truth, making it harder for you to see your true identity. If you have truly found identity then lies are easily discernible.

*** What I think Hell is like
Some people think a person with lies in their identity already is in Hell. I think that's not far from the truth.

Imagine every type of truth save for personal truth used as a slander.
Imagine in Hell, everyone saying so eloquently "We all came to the conclusion that you are a monster X because A,B,C,D -- all the things you did in your life which you remember and they tell you you still are, whilst in your heart you wish none of it was so, and are left feeling like you deserve this."
You were tricked into denying personal truth all your life, so you failed to let Jesus in to remove the weights, now this is what it is like for the rest of eternity.
Hell is composed of lies. Lies are not false in any of these truth senses -- that's what makes them sting.
But because you don't have the alethiometer of absolute truth you now swim in a lake of it.
But if you had identity in Christ they wouldn't mean anything.

I know for a fact that anyone could accuse me
of not being a Christian for a million reasons.
But based on trust in this personal truth I
have, in my personal truth I know that I
am in Christ and hope that I don't forget it.

** What is soul?
In the Bible, I think the soul is conceptually the spiritual part of you which is not mind or body.
For sure, your identity.

Soul in the Aristotle's philosophy is everything else aside
from spirit (for example, mind, body, imagination, astral), though Aristotle didn't believe in spirit.
That's the definition I like to use; In this case we have spirit + soul.

It is what is able to be duplicated in the form of an AI - rational, imaginative mind and body. And that is arriving today.

Our [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/hierarchy-of-souls/][soul]] may die but spirit cannot be destroyed because it is made of the stuff of absolute truth, which I'll call spiritual truth, even the truth of corruption of spiritual truth.
However, soul can be reconstructed from spirit, and in fact the return of Christ is going to be so wild that body and soul on this Earth may go towards the new soul bodies.
So we are given and experience a brand new, or cleaned up soul. Essentially, we are remade from the ground-up on perfect truth.

# ** The nature of death
# We are already in the process of dying. The
# time in our decent which we cling to the rope
# is different for all. The sacrifice God made
# reaches through all stages of the mortal life
# including death because it was a spiritual
# sacrifice. He can be found in all modes of
# consciousness.

** Terminology
Spirit, soul and hologram are defined here in *my* own way.

+ spirit :: I have defined spirit as the bedrock of personal truth, and soul as the emanation or hologram of that.

+ soul :: Body + Mind + Astral. Everything emanated from spirit. May also be defined as a separate construct from body.

+ body :: The physical part of soul.

+ hologram [of soul] :: Emanation of experience through spirit. The unique light of God's light being refracted through your spirit (personal truth).

As of <2022-04-26 Tue>, 7 days after writing this article, I have discovered the Kabbalah and are reading about it.

Fascinatingly, there are so many overlapping ideas.
Soul, however is defined a little differently in the Kabbalah.

I recommend finding your personal truth first
and then using it to read other documents such
as Kabbalah, rather than attempting it the
other way around.

The reason is that if you have a conception of
who is God then He continues to be your
ground-truth, which you can use to compare to
what you read. This is the alethiometer of
truth I am talking about for helping you to
navigate while reading.

** In conclusion!
1. You can't become perfect truth by lying to yourself! You must understand your personal truth, and invite Jesus into it.
2. You can't make that personal truth into perfect truth without understanding who you are making it for! Jesus isn't just a name.
3. You can't know who you are making it for without learning who God is behind the name; You need to understand and obey his commandments in accordance with your personal truth! Not in accordance with consensus truth, or pragmatic truth, or constructivist truth, or coherence truth, or even pragmatic truth. In other words; Not by works, not by learning the right words or speaking them right, not by the virtue of human consensus.
4. You can't understand his commandments without following them! You can't lie to yourself while doing this. You have to follow them to the core of your personal truth. It's different for different people. When you follow them, it must be in accordance with your personal truth.
5. Then it will all click!

You realise that your identity matrix with the
added columns now in theory can make your
entire personal truth validated by math. This is known to be true personally.
On judgement, the identity matrix is validated. It equates to true!

I believe God can save and catch a person's soul and spirit even after they have died, and a person in spirit may come to know Jesus.
Consider when Jesus raises a dead girl. Jesus absolutely may catch a person's fall.
He went there Himself. This is what I believe. I pray for those that met their end without coming to know their true identity while awake in this life.

+ =Psalm 139:8= :: If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.

Try to turn your spiritual truth into Jesus' truth, and live it out - That is the Way.

Jesus is the Way and the Truth (that you needed) and the Life (that you *actually* want), substantially!

Because it's not scientific as I described in
the opening paragraph, and is based on
personal truth, all it takes to find acquire
identity is a type of belief - literally!
Belief based on the one type of truth you will never
see posted *anywhere* as being objective
truth. Everything out there tries to evade the
validity of your personal truth.

** Some pretty wild personal evidence
This is personal evidence that my theory which I put in practice indeed worked on me.
God gave me my first three astral projections which demonstrated, Jesus, the Holy Spirit besides me, and being fully in the Holy Spirit and filled with light.
I kid you not. The evidence is in the writing of my blog, and git commits to github =) as it happened in sequence!
I had been researching what truth is and what the human soul is.
I had my first astral projection as I was doing this, spontaneously. In this I had a 'Doubting Thomas' experience - placing my astral hand into a sore in my physical body beneath the right rib.

- https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/

On Easter Saturday I was compelled to write about the 8th commandment, discrimination and awareness that people are more than machines, after I had discovered it.
On Easter Monday I wrote the first version of this article.
On Easter Sunday was the day I came to spiritual awareness and a rooted understanding of being saved.
Yes, this involved asking for salvation again.

A week or so later, I had another astral projection, where I met the Holy Spirit in person, I believe.

- https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-2/

After the second I knew I had the Holy Spirit with me.

The third on happened very recently. It gave me a download letting me experience being full of the Holy Spirit for a short while.
This is the objective and I'm hopeful that it is my future!

- https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-3/

It's not just this but freedom from things which had mastered me.

Thank you God for giving me evidence!

+ The Knowledge Of Truth :: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pWGHUHm8E][The Knowledge Of Truth | Spiritual Conversations w/ Aaron Tomlinson - YouTube]]

I agree with a lot of what they're saying but not all.
I'm still grokking and learning more as I draw closer to God, and I just feel like the Christian paradigm is the One True paradigm.
Aside from the astral projections and the vision, a mere spiritual awakening doesn't seem to do it justice.

I warn severely against practising =channeling=.

Jesus doesn't want us to do this. The hidden danger of seeking truth outside of the Christian paradigm is you may engage in activities that are dangerous spiritually.

=Authentic self= and =integrity= are key to find your personal truth compass.
These people have certainly found it.

The next step after this is to invite God's truth inside.
It's very easy to do once obtaining your integrity.
But to update yourself with the correct truth you must have challenged yourself to understand what Christ's law is because by obeying this  it will teach you what God's character is, and that is how you must then update your own spirit truth identity when in the prone position.

They do attack fundamentalist Christianity a bit in that first 2 minutes; Specifically, teachings about the rapture, the second coming, Hell, etc.
And they think that Hell is just a state of mind. But I don't think this is right, though it's an indicator.

What these people are talking about is one of the important parts of Christianity, particularly of having a spiritual awakening and realising yourself as a spiritual being.
But there's got to be something else. A step beyond merely discovering the divine part of yourself, which is perhaps the 'image of God', which is referred to in Genesis.
That is actual repentance from sin.
Beyond what they've described, I now have a real sense of becoming separated from sin.
When first I wrote this article, I felt like I had an incredibly truthful heart, now it's becoming more like a loving and appreciative heart towards God.

There is also a call to action, which was not talked about in this video, in the form of Jesus' commandments.

One thing in particular which I disagree with is that people are already in Hell, though in a sense yes it's a glimpse of it.

*** Joy
=John 15:10–11=

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  “If you keep my commandments, you will abide
  in my love. . . . These things I have spoken
  to you, that my joy may be in you, and that
  your joy may be full.” 
#+END_SRC

I think there is a certain anhedonia particularly for the empty
pleasures of the world after discovering your personal identity.

Joy is sustained by keeping your eyes on Christ, and following Him in spirit, and through action, and being a torch of light for others to observe.

https://www.christfirst.co.nz/blog/2018/6/4/rsfdujxhcnynvxevq578hpxr0ev7pu

From now on joy is lost when we take our eyes off Christ and walk in error and contradiction of identity.
This is definitely my experience.

  To the naked eye a suit appears to consist of two parts; A jacket and trousers.
  But those two seemingly solid parts are composed of four different fabrics; Cotton, silk, rohrer and wool.

  You cannot make something good until you understand who you're making it for.
  All clothing says something. I've had gentlemen walk into my shop and boast, "Oh I don't care about what I wear."
  And assuming that's true, doesn't that say something too?
  So who is your customer and what are you trying to say about him?
  The man walks through your door; What about him can you observe?
  Is he timid? Hunched over like mid-day clock? Or does he stand with confidence, spine at six and twelve?
  Is this a man of springtime pastel, clamouring to be noticed?
  Or is this a man of grey and brown, blending into the hurried crowd?
  Is this a man comfortable in his station?
  Or does he pine for grander things?
  And who would this man like to be?
  And who is he underneath?
  Take your measure, and when you understand who he is, then you're ready to begin.

After watching this movie later after finishing this article, I found more and more parallels between the movie and what I was writing.
We have to come to know who God is, so we can make ourselves into what is good, something fitting for God.

Also, everyone is lying to each other in this movie! How relevant that it be a movie about deception and uncovering the truth.

  1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit,
  but test the spirits to see whether they are
  from God, because many false prophets have
  gone out into the world. 2 This is how you can
  recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that
  acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the
  flesh is from God, 3 but every spirit that does
  not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is
  the spirit of the antichrist, which you have
  heard is coming and even now is already in the
  world.

  4 You, dear children, are from God and have
  overcome them, because the one who is in you
  is greater than the one who is in the world.
  5 They are from the world and therefore speak
  from the viewpoint of the world, and the world
  listens to them. 6 We are from God, and whoever
  knows God listens to us; but whoever is not
  from God does not listen to us. This is how we
  recognize the Spirit a of truth and the spirit
  of falsehood.
