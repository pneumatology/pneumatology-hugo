gospel
good news
    A gift from God.
{{< /highlight >}}

The Gospel is the news which
Christianity announces and that is the
proclamation of the forgiveness of sins and
fellowship with God restored through Christ.

It means remission of sins and reconciliation
with God through Christ's death by
crucifixion.

12 That we should be to the praise of his
glory, who first trusted in Christ.

13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye
heard the word of truth, the gospel of your
salvation: in whom also after that ye
believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit
of promise,

14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance
until the redemption of the purchased
possession, unto the praise of his glory.

`Sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.`

[Luke 5](https://biblehub.com/kjv/luke/5.htm)
: 30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. 32I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.


## The Gospel (good news) of Jesus {#the-gospel--good-news--of-jesus}

`John 3:17`
: For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.


[Colossians 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201%3A1-14&version=NIV)
: 13 For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, 14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.


[Romans 10:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A9-10&version=NIV)
: 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man bbelieveth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

The word gospel means “good news,” so the
gospel of Christ is the good news of His
coming to provide forgiveness of sins for all
who will believe (Colossians 1:14; Romans
10:9).

Since the first man’s sin, mankind has been
under the condemnation of God (Romans 5:12).

Because everyone breaks God’s perfect law by
committing sin, everyone is guilty (Romans
3:23).

The punishment for the crime of sin is
physical death (Romans 6:23) and then an
eternity spent in a place of punishment
(Revelation 20:15; Matthew 25:46).

This eternal separation from God is also
called the “second death” (Revelation
20:14–15).

The bad news that all are guilty of sin and
condemned by God is countered by the gospel,
the good news of Jesus Christ.

God, because of His love for the world, has
made a way for man to be forgiven of their
sins (John 3:16).

He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take the
sins of mankind on Himself through death on a
cross (1 Peter 2:24).

In placing our sin on Christ, God ensured that
all who will believe in the name of Jesus will
be forgiven (Acts 10:43).

Jesus’ resurrection guarantees the
justification of all who believe (Romans
4:25).

### Spiritual circumcision {#spiritual-circumcision}

Spiritually, this is a bit like removing the
spiritual corruption/gangrene so your spirit
can be knitted with the body of Christ.

Souls may be knit together through love.

[1 Samuel 18:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2018&version=ESV)
: 18 As soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.


[Thomas 25](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas/gospelthomas25.html)
: (25) Jesus said: Love your brother as your soul; watch over him like the apple of your eye.

Christian brothers and sisters have their souls knitted together.

[Colossians 2:2, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2&version=KJV)
: That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;

But before your soul can be knitted with Jesus' soul, you must prepare your heart and spiritual identity.

This is a 2-stage process:

-   Baptism of water
-   Baptism of spirit


### Baptism of water {#baptism-of-water}

John proclaims baptism of repentance for the
forgiveness of sin, and says another will come
after him who will not baptize with water, but
with the Holy Spirit.
{{< /highlight >}}

You can use the 10 commandments to clean your spirit - they're the `actions` of the heart.
For example, `mixing` is an action when cooking.

If you do the actions with the heart you will
clean your heart. And you'll be able to notice
God; Having swept your house, you become
eligible to have the guest live inside (The Holy Spirit).

The 10 commandments point to an impossible standard
which people need a sacrifice for to be forgiven of transgressions, since we are not perfect, until we are perfected with Jesus' spirit knit with our own.

`Baptism of repentance`
: Frustratingly, the way the gospel (good news) is presented in the modern-day is usually
    in such a way that it first condemns to make you **feel** guilty about things which you innocently do, and feels arbitrary,
    then to say you can be forgiven and be guilt-free if you only believe in Jesus for forgiveness.

This simulation of guilt and then forgiveness
is a bit like a 'baptism' (submersion and
emersion), but I would say this not a complete way to baptise.

The Jews who John the baptist preached to would've already been aware of the 10 commandments, and that is the difference - this part cannot be skipped.

Repentance is obedient following of commandments.
Baptism of water is a declaration that a person will repent.
When a person repents, they learn of God's character and what it's like to be Jesus when they are persecuted.

This puts the person into a primed position to be baptised by the Holy Spirit.

`Thomas Saying 69`
: (69) Jesus said, "Blessed are they who have been persecuted within themselves. It is they
    who have truly come to know the father. Blessed are the hungry, for the belly of him who
    desires will be filled."

In my theory, rather than merely telling someone they are guilty, they must first learn to walk in the commandments to **learn who God is** from **experience**.
A person must learn who God the Father is and who the Son is, by way of emulation of their character, through their words and commands.
This makes the understanding **deeply rooted**, not merely of understanding of unattainable spiritual perfection, but to understand at which point of being persecuted what it's like to be Jesus.

`1 John 2:3-6`
: Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, "I know Him," and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.

The experience is different for different people; This is like submersion and re-emersion in that it's a rite of passage.

I don't think a water baptism is strictly necessary
but I'm **convinced** that the actions of the heart are, which the ceremony is supposed to set into motion.
The knowledge of God's character is important to understand before an encounter with Jesus.
The mere idea of God's character of but the personal experience of it in relation to you.

John the baptist came to prepare the way for the Lord Jesus.

`Mark 1:1-9`

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
“I will send my messenger ahead of you,
    who will prepare your way”[c]—
“a voice of one calling in the wilderness,
‘Prepare the way for the Lord,
    make straight paths for him.’”
{{< /highlight >}}

In summary, the rite of passage which water baptism represents is needed in order to be born again of spirit, I think.

It's a two-stage process.
The end result is being born of God (the Christian God).
