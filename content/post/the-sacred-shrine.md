[Jude 19](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/jude/19)
: 19 It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit.

[Gospel of Philip](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gop.html)

The homology of the temple of Jerusalem and the temple of the heart:

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
There were three buildings specifically for
sacrifice in Jerusalem.

The one facing the west was called "The Holy".

Another, facing south, was called "The Holy of
the Holy".

The third, facing east, was called "The Holy
of the Holies", the place where only the high
priest enters.

Baptism is "the Holy" building.

Redemption is the "Holy of the Holy".

"The Holy of the Holies" is the bridal
chamber.

Baptism includes the resurrection and the
redemption; the redemption (takes place) in
the bridal chamber.

But the bridal chamber is in that which is
superior to [...] you will not find [...] are
those who pray [...] Jerusalem who [...]
Jerusalem, [...] those called the "Holy of the
Holies" [...] the veil was rent, [...] bridal
chamber except the image [...] above.

Because of this, its veil was rent from top to
bottom.

For it was fitting for some from below to go
upward.

{{< /highlight >}}

Social rules are the Trojan horse of core values.

Different from the diagram of corruption, the diagram of idealised and inclusive society
is not condusive to social rules breaching the temples of identity to corrupt individuals,
nor to breach the shrine of core values.

As you can see, in the diagram of enrichment, personal truth and revelation are
not dependent on others' personal bias, nor their own personal truth.

Different from the diagram of corruption, the system is not designed to
reinforce metastereotypes or self-stigmas from the desecration zone. Rather people come to the sacred shrine
to learn more about themselves and understand in relation to one another. Neither
is it the place for people to desecrate the sacred shrine with their personal
biases; Rather, the personal biases can't
impact the core values because the core values
are inclusive.

In preserving the sacred shrine its values should be transforming the
desecration zone into the shrine. Also, the shrine needs to be defended
from social stigmas infiltrating and becoming
social rules, because then they become core
values which discriminate, turning the shrine
into the desecration zone.

Upon entering the shrine of core-values a person should feel free to express
their personal bias but should bypass the desecration zone to avoid creating
false witness.

{{< /highlight >}}

Within the false shrine, people are placed into boxes.
Conversation is shallow.
Personal truth is never acknowledged, and often discredited as insanity, conspiracy theory, heresy or sinister - as if there is always an evil motive behind a divergence.
People are excluded or marked on the basis of superficial attributes such as culture, gender, race, socioeconomic class, age, sexual orientation, body image, intelligence or lack thereof, and health, etc.
marks or labels.
People are labelled as a way to coerce people into believing a false identity.
Things beyond the physical are never talked about, as that relates to personal truth.
Unconditional love is a personal truth, so it is rebuked.
Lots of social fear.


## Fragile social morality and artificial intelligence {#fragile-social-morality-and-artificial-intelligence}

There will be an exacerbation of the problem
of identity due to artificial intelligence.

Whether you believe it or not, we are heading
into an artificially generated fictional
reality based on artificial imagination. The
consequences of this is that the fragile and
fake moral system will be completely gone.
Don't trust it for your truth or your morals.
It's best to use the time right now to find
your identity and establish your truth compass.


## Identity {#identity}

[Through Heaven's Eyes - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG0a9WFkgzU)

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
A single thread in a tapestry, though it's colour brightly shine,
can never see its purpose in the pattern of the grand design.
And the stone that sits on the very top of the mountain's mighty face,
does it think it's more important than the stones that form the base?
So how can you see what your life is worth or where your value lies?
You can never see through the eyes of man.
You must look at your life, look at your life through heaven's eyes.
{{< /highlight >}}

Once again, people are more than machines and
people's have a uniqueness beyond stereotypes,
stigmas, labels etc. no matter how much
offence it causes other people. Their identity is
a unique part of the tapestry with a unique purpose.

So rather than discourage uniqueness,
uniqueness should be celebrated, even when
it's offensive. Uniqueness in character, age,
financial/geographical situation, personal
history, gender identity, deformities, etc.
One person's fiction is another person's
truth, but no-one will ever see objective
truth and find common ground, nor be able to
discern truth from lies unless people first
understand their personal truth and identity.

Discovering uniqueness is discovering truth.

`1 Corinthians 13:6`
: Love does not delight in iniquity but rejoices with the truth.

The absence of love delights in discrimination and delights when the truth is concealed; Delights when people's true identity is suffocated.

Some people are daydreamers, imagineers
so what is truth for them? It's not as simple
as scientific fact/fiction. The measurement
instrument is the person's subjective
experience, not a gyroscope.

Thing's like gender identity, age identity,
ethnic identity, etc. are true to the person.
It's not their fault they are the way they
are, but their nature. But those personal
truths are only the starting point of
identity. Reality of identity is sacred - that
part of reality isn't up for debate; The whole
experience of life is based on that
foundation. The objective should first be to
understand that.

The problem with discrimination is it keeps
people questioning the perceived attributes, beliefs system, and validity of their identity, and not
focused on more important things such as
ideas, hopes, dreams etc. which constitutes
99% of the person and is the true emanation of
a person's soul after a person has bypassed the blanket of insecurity;
The important '**real**' stuff after you sort out
identity, the things that differentiate between human and grass.


### Place in society {#place-in-society}

So the problem is this: People make low-level
judgements about people on their
perceived attributes. The attention is on the
stupid stuff which is the outwards perception of 1% of a person and is unchangeable. Labels are
not even true as their identity is different. People don't accept themselves so
they can't accept God.

Ideas, hopes, dreams aren't talked about. The
full diversity of relationships and viewpoints, and progress beyond the normal
are not allowed to exist.

Simple things like communication need to be
upheld and kept above the swamp of stupidity
(attacking personal identity, and casting
labels), and institutions which discriminate
should be dismantled.

A person is born into this world as a seed and
grows into their fullness. They choose what
they want to be -- that's what the subject of
discussion should be, and try to nurture that.
This gives hope and a reason to live for
the person, rather than making people conform
to social norms. Why teach ignorance and self-
degredation?

My frustration are institutions which
allow social rules and institutional rules
(structural stigmas) to keep people at level 1
and stop them from living up to their
potential.

A mature adult isn't their perceived
attributes anymore and neither should a young
person be taught that they are.

The sacred shrine should be a place without
division or discrimination. People should
feel safe to be themselves and people should
be taught to see others the way Heaven does.
The sacred shrine should despise
discrimination just as God does, never separate people, never embed false witness
by asserting the universal truth of social rules,
and encourage socialisation. Dismantle itself before it dismantles unity.

The fruits of that are so good:

-   is fewer communication problems
-   better conversation
-   people finding their place
-   building confidence
-   people coming to identity in Christ

A person's place in such a society is the
place of a first-class citizen with no passport.
And I'm not even talking about a Vaccine
Passport. I'm talking about partaking in any
part of the community without discrimination or prejudice.

I recognise this is idealised but judgement
should not be cast without precedent and
discernment. **NEVER** use labels. Stand up to
all forms of discrimination when you see it.
Don't allow segregation to continue. Dismantle exclusionary rules.

Why have I written this article? Because it's
not worth throwing my life away by continuing
to accept lies, either when it's happening within my visible range, or internally.

### What is the likeness of Christ we are supposed to transform to? {#what-is-the-likeness-of-christ-we-are-supposed-to-transform-to}

The likeness of Christ isn't destroying your
personal uniqueness. It's becoming someone who
doesn't spread false witness, who doesn't discriminate, etc.
Christ didn't discriminate. Christ actively broke down walls that discriminate etc.
It's a person becoming confident in their identity, and treating others the same way.


## The reason for the 8th commandment {#the-reason-for-the-8th-commandment}

To protect souls so they can be saved in their originality,
and so people can obtain discernment.
The commandment is literally for people's
protection and to allow them to find God and help eachother.
Discrimination is manslaughter against people's souls.
Do not discriminate! Of all the commandments I
think this one is the most important, yet the
most overlooked.

[Mark 12:30-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2012%3A30-31&version=NIV)
: You could say 'do not discriminate' is part of the greatest commandment according to Jesus.

<!--listend-->

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart
and with all your soul and with all your mind
and with all your strength.’[a] 31 The second
is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b]
There is no commandment greater than these.”

## What does Jesus mean by `solid ground`? He's talking about `base truth` or `personal truth` {#what-does-jesus-mean-by-solid-ground-he-s-talking-about-base-truth-or-personal-truth}

This means build the foundation of personal truth, which the belief system sits upon.
The portion of Jesus' spirit given to you integrates itself into your `base truth`.
