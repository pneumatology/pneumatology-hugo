God is Truth -- of the spiritual type.
If your heart is True and pure
then you can see God, you are a child of God and
you are an eternal spirit - [but how?](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/)

-   [John 7:38-](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207%3A38&version=NIV) “He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’ ”

When you've seen God with spiritual eyes, a spring of living water is planted in the soul, gushing up to eternal life.

[Thomas 59](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas/gospelthomas59.html)
: (59) Jesus said, "Look at the living one while you are alive, lest you die and seek to see him but are not able to do so."

A person can't forget this experience because a new standard is set for what is absolutely True; They have glimpsed who and what God is.
How do you know? [You must become truth](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/), through Jesus.

[Proverbs 4:23](https://biblehub.com/text/proverbs/4-23.htm)
: מִֽכָּל־ _mik-kāl_ `With all` מִ֭שְׁמָר _miš-mār_ `diligence` נְצֹ֣ר _nə-ṣōr_ `keep` לִבֶּ֑ךָ _lib-be-ḵā;_ `your heart` כִּֽי־ _kî-_ `for` מִ֝מֶּ֗נּוּ _mim-men-nū,_ `out of it` תּוֹצְא֥וֹת _tō-wṣ-’ō-wṯ_ `[spring] the issues` חַיִּֽים׃ _ḥay-yîm._ `of life`.

Sin makes you untruthful.

[Galatians 3:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203&version=NIV)
: 21 Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not!(AJ) For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.(AK) 22 But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin,(AL) so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.

God's children have been [reborn](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/) of the Holy Spirit.

[Isaiah 66:2](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/isaiah/66/2)
: 2 All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares the Lord. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.


## Some feelings of the spirit-self {#some-feelings-of-the-spirit-self}

Our spirit is our own truth compass.

-   The burning away of soul
    -   People or circumstances forcing you, in this moment, to live a lie
    -   When you're left to burn away time
    -   When you are in the wrong place
    -   When pressured into being somewhere you're not supposed to be, and can't do what's best for yourself without persecution
    -   The feeling of not being able to talk to the one you love
    -   Every second in the wrong place feels like your life force is being consumed and burning away
-   A full heart
    -   You found the courage to voice your truth
    -   You're where you want to be,
    -   having done what you needed to do
    -   You feel loved, though to identify where
        this love originates, no rational minded
        person could explain.
    -   You feel loved by God when you are able to
        do that which is your truth.
    -   This is the initial evidence that personal truth exists
    -   It is evidence that God exists that your true love exists, and can be lived out
    -   This is the peace and love of God
-   The candle in your heart
    -   Piercing like a flame
    -   A spring bubbling with truth, with assurance
    -   A never ending power-cell in your heart
    -   It makes you laugh when you notice it
    -   Anticipation of heaven
    -   More than you need
    -   Extinguishes the hellfire. Your soul feels rest
    -   Compelling you to share your happiness
    -   The Water of Life flows from the throne of God
    -   It will keep you from dying
    -   It has the power to save others

_**Water of Life (Eternal Truth)**_

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/water-melee.jpg" >}}

White is associated with truth, purity,
cleansing, healing and protection. It is a
good general healing color for the removal of
pain and suffering. In the aura it signifies a
high level of attainment, a higher level soul
incarnate to help others.

Water on white is the depiction of the Water of Life.

</div>

`Carl Jung (1913)`
: A truth is a truth, when it works. That is how we know the truth: the truth is that which helps us to live – to live properly.


## Preparing the heart {#preparing-the-heart}


### Plato {#plato}

Eternal Truth may be as intractable as [Plato's ideal forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory%5Fof%5Fforms) to most people.

But it is a reality which you can know in your deepest self, and come to experience
only while having a spiritual identity that
has Jesus' Truth added to it, -to correct your internal alethiometer which perceives the world. Your spirit must be 'free of corruption' but with dependency on Jesus.

If you sin but then genuinely follow Jesus' voice agian, it feels like Jesus pushes back on you.


### Vedhaantha (Hinduism) {#vedhaantha--hinduism}

The teachings of Sri Sathya Sai (Indian guru) point to integrity bringing forth bliss, truth and joy.

I agree, it is more than this, read on.

I'm saying that a person can come to Jesus
from Platonism or Hinduism, or from anywhere
for that matter.

To have this a person must walk in their truth and external actions must reflect the inside.

-   <https://mullikine.github.io/posts/living-water/>

-   Teachings of _**Sri Sathya Sai**_ - all sounds good to me:
    -   <https://www.sathyasai.org/>
    -   <https://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume14/sss14-34.pdf>
    -   <https://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume15/sss15-35.pdf>

Every man should strive to achieve unity in thought, word and deed.

This profound truth is proclaimed by the
Vedhaanthik pronouncement that the body is a
temple in which the [eternal Aathma](https://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume15/sss15-35.pdf) is the Indweller.

"Manas-anyath, vachas-anyath, karmanya-anyath dhuraathmanaam"
: The wicked are those whose thoughts deviate from their words and actions.

<!--listend-->

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
The Veda is dualistic. Vedhaantha is monistic (Adhvaitha).

The essence of Vedhaantha is the triune unity of thought, word and deed. In this unity, true bliss can be experienced.

It will also demonstrate the spiritual basis of divinity.

All study of Vedhaantha is of no avail if the precepts are not practised.
{{< /highlight >}}

Interesting and overlapping concepts to me!

However, the Holy Spirit and hearing God's voice is about more than mere bliss!

The Holy Spirit's voice and this Living Water,
truly feels like an internal spring, and
blazing fire in your heart and body when you
follow and obey.


### Christian baptism and the heart {#christian-baptism-and-the-heart}

Water baptism - dedication to the obedience of divine precepts, from the heart,
and the unity of inner and outer truth aligns your heart to God, so that you can see God.
Bliss comes from this.


## The Living Spring - Scriptures {#the-living-spring-scriptures}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
(108) Jesus said: He who drinks from my mouth will become like me, and I

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
Jesus says: "I am no longer thy master; for
thou hast drunk, thou art inebriated from the
bubbling spring which is mine and which I
sent forth.
{{< /highlight >}}

Know the truth, and pass it on.
Teach others! Show others how to find it, with the method you found.
The spring is real.


### John 10:27-28 {#john-10-27-28}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and
they follow me. I give them eternal life, and
they will never perish, and no one will snatch
them out of my hand.
{{< /highlight >}}

Jesus gives us eternal life.
This is the wellspring of truth bubbling up in our hearts.
First, we must know the truth.


### John 5:24 {#john-5-24}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my
word and believes him who sent me has eternal
life. He does not come into judgment, but has
passed from death to life.
{{< /highlight >}}


### John 14:6 {#john-14-6}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the

### Jeremiah 2:13–19 {#jeremiah-2-13-19}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}

Almighty.”

### [Philippians 4:8](https://biblehub.com/niv/philippians/4.htm) {#philippians-4-8}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is
true, whatever is noble, whatever is right,
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever
is admirable—if anything is excellent or
praiseworthy—think about such things.
Whatever you have learned or received or
heard from me, or seen in me—put it into
practice. And the God of peace will be with
you.
{{< /highlight >}}

You're allowed to think of the person you love, even if they're cut off from you.
When you're being true, your soul finds rest.


### Ode 12 {#ode-12}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
For the dwelling place of the Word is man, and His truth is love.
Blessed are they who by means of Him have perceived everything, and have known the Lord in His truth.
{{< /highlight >}}


### [Book of Thomas the Contender](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/bookt.html) (Jude Thomas, missionary to India) {#book-of-thomas-the-contender--jude-thomas-missionary-to-india}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
To the fool, however, the good and bad are the
same - indeed the wise man will be nourished
by the truth and (Ps. 1:3) "will be like a
tree growing by the meandering stream" -
seeing that there are some who, although
having wings, rush upon the visible things,
things that are far from the truth.
{{< /highlight >}}

This speaks against to belief systems which do
not believe in good and evil.

While being led by the Spirit of Truth it's
possible to get vision/resolution to notice it
more easily.


### John 4:4–26 {#john-4-4-26}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
But he had to go through Samaria.

So he came to a Samaritan city called Sychar,
near the plot of ground that Jacob had given
to his son Joseph.

Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired out
by his journey, was sitting by the well.

It was about noon.

A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and
Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink." (His
disciples had gone to the city to buy food.)
The Samaritan woman said to him, "How is it
that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of
Samaria?" (Jews do not share things in common
with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, "If you
knew the gift of God, and who it is that is
saying to you, 'Give me a drink', you would
have asked him, and he would have given you
living water." The woman said to him, "Sir,
you have no bucket, and the well is deep.

Where do you get that living water? Are you
greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us
the well, and with his sons and his flocks
drank from it?" Jesus said to her, "Everyone
who drinks of this water will be thirsty
again, but those who drink of the water that I
will give them will never be thirsty.

The water that I will give will become in them
a spring of water gushing up to eternal life."
The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this
water, so that I may never be thirsty or have
to keep coming here to draw water." Jesus said
to her, "Go, call your husband, and come
back." The woman answered him, "I have no
husband." Jesus said to her, "You are right in
saying, 'I have no husband'; for you have had
five husbands, and the man you are now living
with is not your husband.

What you have said is true!" The woman said to
him, "Sir, I see that you are a prophet.

Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but
you say that the place where people must
worship is in Jerusalem." Jesus said to her,
"Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when
you will worship the Father neither on this
mountain nor in Jerusalem.

You worship what you do not know; we worship
what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.

But the hour is coming, and is now here, when
the true worshippers will worship the Father
in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such
as these to worship him.

God is spirit, and those who worship him must
worship in spirit and truth." The woman said
to him, "I know that Messiah is coming" (who
is called Christ).

"When he comes, he will proclaim all things to
us." Jesus said to her, "I am he, the one who
is speaking to you."

### [The Odes of Solomon](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/odes.html) (first or second century AD) {#the-odes-of-solomon--first-or-second-century-ad}

He has filled me with words of truth, that I may proclaim Him.
And like the flowing of waters, truth flows from my mouth, and my lips declare His fruits.
Blessed, therefore, are the ministers of that drink, who have been entrusted with His water.
Even living persons who were about to expire, they have held back from death.
Because everyone recognized them as the Lord's, and lived by the living water of eternity.
From the beginning until the end I received His knowledge.
And I was established upon the rock of truth, where He had set me.
And speaking waters touched my lips from the fountain of the Lord generously.
And so I drank and became intoxicated, from the living water that does not die.
And my intoxication did not cause ignorance, but I abandoned vanity.
I rejected the folly cast upon the earth.
As a fountain gushes forth its water, so my heart gushes forth the praise of the Lord, and my lips bring forth praise to Him.
His possessions are immortal life, and those who receive it are incorruptible.

1 Behold, the Lord is our mirror. Open your eyes and see them in Him.
2 And learn the manner of your face, then declare praises to His Spirit.
3 And wipe the paint from your face, and love His holiness and put it on.
4 Then you will be unblemished at all times with Him.
{{< /highlight >}}

This is so true.
The perfect identity.
The divine scales of spiritual truth.

1 Fill for yourselves water from the living fountain of the Lord, because it has been opened for you.
2 And come all you thirsty and take a drink, and rest beside the fountain of the Lord.
3 Because it is pleasing and sparkling, and perpetually refreshes the self.
4 For much sweeter is its water than honey, and the honeycomb of bees is not to be compared with it;
5 Because it flowed from the lips of the Lord, and it named from the heart of the Lord.
6 And it came boundless and invisible, and until it was set in the middle they knew it not.
7 Blessed are they who have drunk from it, and have refreshed themselves by it. Hallelujah.

### [John 14:16-30 ERV](https://www.bible.com/bible/406/JHN.14.16-30.ERV) {#john-14-16-30-erv}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
I will ask the Father, and he will give you
another Helper to be with you forever.

The Helper is the Spirit of truth.

The people of the world cannot accept him,
because they don’t see him or know him.

But you know him.

He lives with you, and he will be in you.

“I will not leave you all alone like orphans.

I will come back to you.

In a very short time the people in the world
will not see me anymore.

But you will see me.

You will live because I live.

On that day you will know that I am in the
Father.

You will know that you are in me and I am in
you.

Those who really love me are the ones who not
only know my commands but also obey them.

My Father will love such people, and I will
love them.

I will make myself known to them.” Then Judas
(not Judas Iscariot) said, “Lord, how will you
make yourself known to us, but not to the
world?” Jesus answered, “All who love me will
obey my teaching.

My Father will love them.

My Father and I will come to them and live
with them.

But anyone who does not love me does not obey
my teaching.

This teaching that you hear is not really
mine.

It is from my Father who sent me.

“I have told you all these things while I am
with you.

But the Helper will teach you everything and
cause you to remember all that I told you.

This Helper is the Holy Spirit that the Father
will send in my name.

“I leave you peace.

It is my own peace I give you.

I give you peace in a different way than the
world does.

So don’t be troubled.

Don’t be afraid.

You heard me say to you, ‘I am leaving, but I
will come back to you.’ If you loved me, you
would be happy that I am going back to the
Father, because the Father is greater than I
am.

I have told you this now, before it happens.

Then when it happens, you will believe.

“I will not talk with you much longer.

The ruler of this world is coming.

He has no power over me.

### Ode 24 {#ode-24}

And the Lord destroyed the devices, of all those who had not the truth with them.
For they were lacking in wisdom, they who exalted themselves in their mind.
So they were rejected, because the truth was not with them.
For the Lord revealed His way, and spread widely His grace.
And those who understood it knew His holiness.
{{< /highlight >}}

Some people exalt themselves, thinking themselves fortunate to have born into the right body to be saved.
Fools. The body and the outwards appearance doesn't save.
It will be harder for them to make their heart truthful.

[1 Corinthians 15:50 KJV](https://biblehub.com/kjv/1%5Fcorinthians/15-50.htm)

praxis
    Key in meditation and spirituality, where
    emphasis is placed on gaining first-hand
    experience of concepts and certain areas,
    such as union with the Divine, which can
    only be explored through praxis due to the
    inability of the finite mind (and its
    tool, language) to comprehend or express
    the infinite.

    Wisdom is always taste (in both Latin and
    Hebrew), the word for wisdom comes from
    the word for taste.

    Wisdom is something to taste, not
    something to theorize about.

## The personal cistern {#the-personal-cistern}

I believe that at the heart of a person, God is seen differently by different people, as in seeing different facets of the same God.
The cistern is your personal source of truth and joy.


### [Proverbs 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%205&version=KJV) {#proverbs-5}

`Lest thou give thine honour unto others`
: Do not let thieves trick you into giving them your honour. Similar to 'do not throw your pearls before swine'. If you are faithful to someone then hold onto that; It's not just a gift. A person builds their life on their honour which is their personal truth which involves true love.

When a person's honour is given to those who are undeserving (i.e themselves faithless), it damages that person's foundation of their life, setting them back to square 1.

To build something great, whether it's a relationship, or a project, a belief system, or even knowledge itself, in order to advance and build something elaborate, the foundations of knowledge, and a person's true belief in it must be strong. Removing honour and self-worth erodes the foundation of a person. I live by this; In job, career, love and my knowledge, I build upwards.

The treasure you save for the right person, or to God.

Others (normal people; faithless), who's hearts are themselves full of
adultery, trick you into giving up and relinquishing this treasure.

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.
17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings.
22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
{{< /highlight >}}

More importantly than mere marriage, I believe the cistern represents the **truth** of your source of truth and joy.
At all times be faithful to it.
Your personal truth is not for other people to trample over and rewrite. Do not share with others in this way.
And no matter what, with what spring of truth is given to you, you must drink from this cistern and not other people's.
To drink from another's cistern is to corrupt yourself.
From a marriage standpoint, your wife is your cistern.
Generally, the idea of self-integrity (faithfulness to yourself) and integrity of word (and persona), and unto God is still relevant.


## The Personal Cistern and the Living Spring {#the-personal-cistern-and-the-living-spring}

The personal cistern is the source of a
person's truth and joy. This is where the
Living Spring is planted.

To upgrade the cistern, you must make yourself into spiritual truth, and retain it through the Holy Spirit
: [The Tapestry of Truth](https://semiosis.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/)


## Knowing who God is {#knowing-who-god-is}

I think that putting on immortality is like making your heart pure and 'seeing God'.

These passages allude to that idea:

[1 Corinthians 15:53](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+15&version=KJV)
: 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.


[1 Corinthians 15:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+15&version=KJV)
: 34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.


## The Next Level: Spiritual Understanding - Soul-bonding with Christ {#the-next-level-spiritual-understanding-soul-bonding-with-christ}

[1 Corinthians 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202%3A14&version=NIV)
: Only those aided by God's Holy Spirit have the capacity to understand spiritual things, including God's plan of salvation through faith in the crucified Christ.

This is a step beyond becoming truthful!
You must at this point:

-   confess that the God of <span class="underline">Spiritual Truth</span> and <span class="underline">Agape Love</span> is your Father
-   confess Jesus is your Saviour
-   confess that the Holy Spirit is your Councilor
-   ask for Jesus to enter into your heart!
-   ask for the Holy Spirit to enter into your heart!

After that, the mysteries of knowledge and wisdom are revealed to you over time, only a few weeks for me!

`Gospel of Thomas (28)`
: Jesus said, "I took my place in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in
    flesh. I found all of them intoxicated; I found none of them thirsty. And my soul became
    afflicted for the sons of men, because they are blind in their hearts and do not have sight;
    for empty they came into the world, and empty too they seek to leave the world. But for
    the moment they are intoxicated. When they shake off their wine, then they will repent."

Consider that this is with the intention of
making our own spirits truthful, so we can see God and receive eternal life.

Firstly, we 'see' God by 'understanding' what spiritual truth is, and God as being the ideal form of it! Like a perfect triangle or ideal form (Plato).
Secondly, we **may** get a chance to 'see' God by meeting Him in the Bridal Chamber!

Through faith we can become spiritually true, acceptable to God, but
that this depends on grace through Jesus.

Though we are now truthful with dependency on grace, and we maintain it with the spirit of Jesus inside of us!

Truth and Love are two sides of the same coin.
It is an act of love to God to abide in His divine law; To love one another, and to love God (truth).

`Romans 13:8-10 ESV`
: Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

Those not helped by God's Spirit simply
cannot comprehend spiritual truth. They can
grasp things intellectually ([Romans 1:18–23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201%3A18-23&version=NIV);
[James 2:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202%3A19&version=NIV)), but that does not mean they can
attain spiritual understanding. They don't
have the capacity to understand or believe
anything beyond the material world ([Isaiah 55:8–9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2055%3A8-9&version=NIV)).

Faithfulness is a very true type of love.
