## Relevant background reading {#relevant-background-reading}

I had this vision shortly after writing the
first revision of the following article.

[Job 33:15-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2033%3A15-18&version=NIV)
: In a dream, in a vision of the night,
    when deep sleep falls on people
    as they slumber in their beds,
    16 he may speak in their ears
    and terrify them with warnings,
    17 to turn them from wrongdoing
    and keep them from pride,
    18 to preserve them from the pit,
    their lives from perishing by the sword.[a]


[Matthew 5:30](https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/matthew/5/30)
: 30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

Visions generally have more clarity than
dreams, but traditionally fewer psychological
connotations. Visions are known to emerge from
spiritual traditions and could provide a lens
into human nature and reality
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
A spiritual vision is like watching
something happen in front of you as clear as
if you were seeing it on television. They
present themselves through the minds eye in
several ways. ... They are vivid and feels
real... Spiritual visions are usually some
kind of message or connection to something
happening elsewhere.

`The Evil of Evils` by  by Jeremiah Burroughs (1654)
: [The Eighth Book of Mr. Jeremiah Burroughs: Being a Treatise of the Evil of Evils, Or the Exceeding Sinfulness of Sin](https://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/burroughs/The%20Evil%20of%20Evils%20-%20Jeremiah%20Burroughs.pdf).


## <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-04-23 Sat&gt; </span></span> A vision. What does it mean? {#a-vision-dot-what-does-it-mean}

This morning for a brief 10 seconds, I had a very vivid
vision. The background was white, and my right hand was in front of it, palm facing me and index finger pointing.
An earthworm which was leaving my index finger to the far left of under the nail through flesh.
I could not feel any pain.
I did not know what it was (or did not see it as a threat).
I was oblivious like a child; Perhaps that means innocent, at least unto myself.
Though the right hand is alive I had very little sensation of feeling from it.
I pinched it with my left hand but it was strong and I started pushing it back in.
I woke up before it was all the way back in.
It was not a normal dream at all. It was short, vivid, clear and symbolic, with nothing extra.


### Symbolism {#symbolism}

The worm in this vision was a decay worm.
I was aware of the unholiness of it (at least
initially) and began removing it, but started
putting the worm back after forgetting, or not
considering it unholy.
The white background may symbolise judgement, purity, truth or spirit.
My hand I think represented my writing. It has to be because I'd just done a lot of writing.


### Interpretation 1 - <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-04-23 Sat&gt; </span></span> - writing {#interpretation-1-writing}

My instinct told me it may be something evil which is here to feed on the virtue of my writing. I do not know. [Interpretations](https://evangelistjoshua.com/dream-about-worms/).
It's possible that I do not know what the worms are in my writing.
I do not know this for sure. But I will do my best to nullify its threat by being as honorable to God in everything I do.
Over the following couple of weeks I continued refining the article to compensate.


### Interpretation 2 - <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-04-23 Sat&gt; </span></span> - avoiding impurity {#interpretation-2-avoiding-impurity}

A good answer I think came from the Gospel of Truth a few days later
: <https://youtu.be/MoaX1S3GNyc?t=1499>

<!--listend-->

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
Do not be moth-eaten. Do not be worm-eaten.
For you have already gotten rid of that.
{{< /highlight >}}

This may be symbolic of my personal life.
Yes it's true that at this stage I had gotten rid of lies and all bad behaviour.
I have to remain strong and not allow them to come back in.
Or does this symbolise I will not be able to sustain it?
I still think it's about the writing specifically due to the hand and index finger.


### Interpretation 3 - <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-04-23 Sat&gt; </span></span> - Give God the Glory {#interpretation-3-give-god-the-glory}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
21 On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. 22They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.” 23 Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.
{{< /highlight >}}

After reading this I put it in.


### Interpretation 4 - <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-05-17 Tue&gt; </span></span> - the hell worm {#interpretation-4-the-hell-worm}

<https://www.gotquestions.org/worm-will-not-die.html>

I don't understand.
It's really nagging at me.

`Mark 9:46`
: Jesus Christ says about hell: "Where THEIR WORM dies not, and the fire is not quenched."

This is a vision of the personal worm.
So what does it eat in my dream? My spirit hand I guess.
It's possible that I saw the worm, the one that is left to us.

`Isaiah 51:6 ESV`
: Lift up your eyes to the heavens, look at the earth beneath; the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment and its inhabitants die like flies. But my salvation will last forever, my righteousness will never fail.

The Earth wears out and inhabitants are left.

`Isaiah 51:7 ESV`
: "Hear me, you who know what is right, you people who have my law in your hearts: Do not fear the reproach of men or be terrified by their insults.


`Isaiah 51:8 ESV`
: For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool; but my righteousness will be forever, and my salvation to all generations.”

Perhaps it is a warning against innocence following one in their midst - self innocence is not enough. Neither is following after the wrong person.

`Isaiah 66:17`
: “Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, zeating pig’s flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, declares the Lord.

Whoever held the worm, me or not, pulled it out only to look at it and push it back, yet it is still a worm.
That to me indicates the person is allowing the worm back.
Perhaps it could mean that innocence before oneself may not be enough, and that we need extra knowledge - the knowledge of the law of God.
Or perhaps it's a warning that I will do that.


### Interpretation 5 - <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-05-19 Thu&gt;</span></span> {#interpretation-5}

-   <https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/fear-not-you-worm-jacob#israel-as-a-worm>

<!--listend-->

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
13 For I am the Lord your God
    who takes hold of your right hand
and says to you, Do not fear;
    I will help you.
14 Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob,
    little Israel, do not fear,
for I myself will help you,” declares the Lord,
    your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
In Job 25:4–6 Bildad says to Job, "How can man be righteous before God? How can he who is born of woman be clean? Behold, even the moon is not bright and the stars not clean in his sight; how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!" The least we can say from this passage is that one meaning the term "worm" has when applied to man is that he is unclean, unrighteous, unacceptable to God.
{{< /highlight >}}

It can also mean that a person's own innocence
in their own eyes is not enough.


### Interpretation 6 - <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-06-13 Mon&gt;</span></span> {#interpretation-6}

Desensitised to sin.


### Interpretation 7 - <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-06-13 Mon&gt;</span></span> {#interpretation-7}

Regeneration by Holy Spirit.

<https://www.bible-knowledge.com/regeneration-by-holy-spirit/>


### Interpretation 8 - <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-06-13 Mon&gt;</span></span> {#interpretation-8}

God allows the worm to stay.

`The Evil of Evils` by  by Jeremiah Burroughs (1654)
: [The Eighth Book of Mr. Jeremiah Burroughs: Being a Treatise of the Evil of Evils, Or the Exceeding Sinfulness of Sin](https://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/burroughs/The%20Evil%20of%20Evils%20-%20Jeremiah%20Burroughs.pdf).

From the above book, sometimes it is allowed
to stay. God sees it but may not kill it
immediately:

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
If it gnaw, there is a sovereign medicine, the blood of Christ: And
certainly there is no Medicine in the world to kill this worm but the
blood of Christ, and those that God does intend to kill this worm in,
and those that shall not have it gnaw to all eternity, God lets it gnaw
now, the Ministry of the Word makes it gnaw and pain them, and
they feel such pain that wheresoever they go, or whatsoever they do
yet the worm lies gnawing upon their hearts, they cannot sleep, or
eat their meat:

Alas! what should I eat, and have my worm gnaw there!

And they can never be at rest till God apply the blood of Christ, and
then they void the worm as it were. How will you rejoice when your
Children, if the worms be great and put them to pain, if the
Physician give them that which makes them void them, how do you
rejoice to see the worm that would have been the death of your
Child? It might have grown bigger and bigger, if it had not been
taken away.

So I dare say there is never a Soul here before the Lord, but has, or
had a worm in their breasts, I say, There was a time you had this
worm in your breasts, that without it were cured, would lie gnawing
to all eternity, it is that which breeds of the filth and corruption of
your hearts.

### Interpretation 9 - <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2022-06-29 Wed&gt;</span></span> {#interpretation-9}

It could also mean that Jesus has become a worm for me.

-   [Psalm 22:6-I Am a Worm | Precept Austin](https://www.preceptaustin.org/psalm%5F226-i%5Fam%5Fa%5Fworm)

A description of Messiah:

[Psalm 22:6](https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-6.htm)
: But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.


### Best guess {#best-guess}

Worms or lies can be hard to see.
We can pull them out and push them in when we lose truth.
If we pull them out they probably die.
In Hell a person's worm does not die.
They are strong. We don't have the strength alone to destroy them.


## Appendix {#appendix}


### Romans 8:12-16 {#romans-8-12-16}

The inapproachable light.

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
12 Fight the good fight of the faith.

Take hold of the eternal life to which you
were called and about which you made the good
confession in the presence of many witnesses.

13 charge you in the presence of God, who
gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus,
who in his testimony before 4 Pontius Pilate
made the good confession, 14 to keep the
commandment unstained and free from reproach
until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
15 which he will display at the proper
time—he who is the blessed and only
Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of
lords, 16 who alone has immortality, who
dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one
has ever seen or can see.

To him be honor and eternal dominion.

Amen.
