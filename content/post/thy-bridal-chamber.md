These were spontaneous and God-given experiences over Easter 2022.

According to the [Gospel of Philip](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-philip/), the sacrament of the Bridal Chamber is not **necessary** for redemption!

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
"Baptism is 'the holy' shrine.
Redemption is 'holy of the holy'.
'The holy of the holies' is the bridal chamber".
{{< /highlight >}}

Also, it's definitely possible to go sin after
the bridal chamber - but we don't make a practice of it.

Sin is not the desirable thing to do - it's far more satisfying to remain faithful!
But it's still challenging sometimes because the world is unjust.

redemption
    The action of saving or being saved from
    sin, error, or evil.
    "God's plans for the redemption of his

The spiritual marriage of man to Christ
represents our union with God by
Grace, the death of the old man, and the
restoration of the Divine Image.

This lofty and unfathomable mystery moves
wholly away from any of the literal (and thus
dangerous) marital images that abound in
Western Christianity.

[Gospel of Philip](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-philip/)
: He said on that day in the thanksgiving, "You who have joined the [perfect light](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/) with the [Holy Spirit](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-2/), unite the angels with us also, as [being the images](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-3/)." Do not despise the lamb, for without it, it is not possible to see the king.

The images could also mean the [image of the androgyne](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/dream-discernment-of-judgement/).
It can also mean the [image of Christ](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-thomas/).


## [Hebrews 10:19-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/HEB.10.19-25) {#hebrews-10-19-25}

Be sincere, meek, loving and facetious, but
above all things `True`. In everything be
`True` - just be like Jesus and you will be
ready. God will allow you to enter the Bridal
Chamber. Seek Jesus like Children, and
boldness will come from sincerity.

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
19 Therefore, brethren, having boldness 6 to
enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus, 20
by a new and oliving way which He consecrated
for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh,
21 and having a High Priest over the house of
God, 22 let us pdraw near with a true heart
qin full assurance of faith, having our hearts
sprinkled from an evil conscience and our
bodies washed with pure water. 23 Let us hold
fast the confession of our hope without
wavering, for He who promised is faithful. 24
And let us consider one another in order to
stir up love and good works, 25 not forsaking
the assembling of ourselves together, as is
the manner of some, but exhorting one another,
and tso much the more as you see uthe Day
approaching.

The males are they which unite with the souls
which inhabit a female form, but the females
are they which are mingled with those in a
male form, though one who was disobedient.

And none shall be able to escape them, since
they detain him if he does not receive a male
power or a female power, the bridegroom and
the bride.

One receives them from the mirrored bridal
chamber.

Thy bridal chamber I see adorned, O my Savior,
and I have no wedding garment that I may enter.
O Giver of Light, enlighten the vesture of my soul, and save me.

## [Gospel of Philip](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gop.html) {#gospel-of-philip}

[Gospel of Philip](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gop.html)
: A bridal chamber is not for the animals, nor is it for the slaves, nor for defiled women; but it is for free men and virgins.

The homology of the physical temple to the
temple of your heart.

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
There were three buildings specifically for
sacrifice in Jerusalem.

The one facing the west was called "The Holy".

Another, facing south, was called "The Holy of
the Holy".

The third, facing east, was called "The Holy
of the Holies", the place where only the high
priest enters.

Baptism is "the Holy" building.

Redemption is the "Holy of the Holy".

"The Holy of the Holies" is the bridal
chamber.
{{< /highlight >}}

See: [The Five Sacraments // Bodacious Blog](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-five-sacraments/)

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
Baptism includes the resurrection and the
redemption; the redemption (takes place) in
the bridal chamber.

But the bridal chamber is in that which is
superior to [...] you will not find [...] are
those who pray [...] Jerusalem who [...]
Jerusalem, [...] those called the "Holy of the
Holies" [...] the veil was rent, [...] bridal
chamber except the image [...] above.

Because of this, its veil was rent from top to
bottom.

For it was fitting for some from below to go
upward.

The powers do not see those who are clothed in
the perfect light, and consequently are not
able to detain them.

## The way I slept {#the-way-i-slept}

It honestly mattered, but I think it was surely predestiny.

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
One will clothe himself in this light
sacramentally in the union.

If the woman had not separated from the man,
she should not die with the man.

His separation became the beginning of death.

Because of this, Christ came to repair the
separation, which was from the beginning, and
again unite the two, and to give life to those
who died as a result of the separation, and
unite them.

But the woman is united to her husband in the
bridal chamber.

Indeed, those who have united in the bridal
chamber will no longer be separated.

Thus Eve separated from Adam because it was
not in the bridal chamber that she united with
him.

-   This document describes the bridal chamber:

This is my visceral experience of the Bridal Chamber.

## [In the Maw of the Bridal Chamber](https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/glory2godforallthings/2020/04/13/in-the-maw-of-the-bridal-chamber/) {#in-the-maw-of-the-bridal-chamber}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
It is a hymn of deep irony and paradox.

The “Bridal Chamber” carries a double meaning.

It is, at once, the place of mystical union
between Christ and His Bride (the Church).

At the same time, it is the grave of Christ
Himself.

For that mystical union with Christ begins by
being “buried with Christ in His death” (in
Holy Baptism).

The marriage of Christ and His Bride is in the
paradox of the hideous maw of death’s domain,
at the same time the place of Christ’s utter
triumph over every adversary.

We are not removed from that terrible place –
we are healed precisely there.

The resurrection of Christ begins in the tomb.

There was no 'ceremony' that I followed.

Whatever happened, happened spontaneously and changed me.

It's surely something of an event at a higher dimension, and a mystery, which I am confident of in retrospect.
